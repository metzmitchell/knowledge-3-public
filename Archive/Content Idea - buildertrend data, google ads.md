## Google Ads - Open Market

We want the most conversion data - because we learn and act first
We don't know how much other people are spending and how quickly they're reacting.

We have discovered this service line is in a competitive market

Imagine everyone is buying and acting on data, so how much they pay and how fast they act determines how everyone else has to act.

We need to discover the price and speed. We have determined a potential competitive price range.

Fixed vs bid.

In Google Ads, the element of time changes how you spend money. You need to discover and react to opportunities before the competition. Assuming equal talent, the company who acquires and reacts to data first will win the most leads.

Talent + data - reaction time = outcome

I always hear foggy logic from Google Ads specialists to arrive at a monthly spend that sounds suspiciously close to the amount required for their fees to make sense.
Why? Where did this number come from?

It's a free market, so the market determines how you act.
