AI Description: Warm Intro Email Draft for DC Builders
Category: Communication Skills, Engagement Strategies
Creation Date: May 28, 2025 9:37 PM
Inputs: - Recipient's name
- Recipient's title
- Company name
- Personal notes about the recipient (e.g., recent projects, shared interests)
- Specific services offered by the recipient's company
- Preferred meeting time options (two non-adjacent times on Friday, June 13, between 11 AM and 5 PM)

**Goal:** Draft a warm, personal intro email (no pitch) to either a:

- **High-end custom home builder**
- **Builder/remodeler**

in **Washington, DC**.

I'll be in town next week for the **NAHB Spring Council Meeting** and would like to swing by on **Friday, June 13** for a quick introduction.

Include a simple, plausible business reason that shows there might be potential for us to work together in the future, framing my value proposition in a way that is relevant to their company and desired outcomes - be specific to them and their services when stating what I do.

- **Don't use an em dash. Don't use ""—""**

**Write an email that**

- opens with a personalized detail from research (""why them, why now"").
- clearly states my travel and availability on **June 13** for a brief 15-minute visit (no pitch, no presentation).
- is **≤170 words**, conversational, and avoids marketing jargon.
- ends with *one* clear, low-friction CTA for me to come to their office (AI should pick two non-adjacent times on Friday the 13th between 11 and 5)

**Format**

1. **Subject:** 2–3 casual words that feel natural and friendly (e.g., “Quick chat Friday?”).
2. **Body:** ≤ 5 short sentences; use line-breaks for readability.
3. **No** logo, signature block, or extra formatting.

**Tone:** Approachable, confident, respectful of their time—like a genuine personal email.

I've included the person's name, title, company name, my personal notes about them, and what services they offer below:
