# This Isn’t An Agency Pitch
I help custom builders use marketing to grow a company that’s trusted, respected, and built to last. From what I’m seeing, I think we could accomplish some great things working together. 

This isn’t another agency pitch. Actually, I’m going to tell you why you shouldn’t hire an agency right now.

Senior builder marketing strategists might close the deal, but you’re not the Toll Brothers, so to keep it affordable, they have to hand you off to junior staff, who don’t understand custom homes. You end up double checking all their work, and ultimately still relying on referrals when the market shifts.

Here’s what I’d do first:
• Audit what’s working (and what isn’t)
• Tighten up the most efficient channels 
• Build a lean, specialized team around your acquisition strategy

Once that’s dialed in, you can scale—and eventually bring it in-house the right way.

Let me know if you want help mapping it out. No pitch. Just ideas.
