    Subject: More projects in Silverleaf
    
    Hey Tim,
    
    I’m recording short videos for a few builders I respect, just showing how your positioning stacks up against current buyer trends.
    
    Do you want me to record one for Beringer Fine Homes Inc? No pitch, only helpful content.
    
    Just reply 'yes' if interested.
    
    PS: I appreciate that you have specific communities listed on your homepage. That's a great move for custom builders. I also have clients publish a separate page about each community. Many communities don't invest in SEO, so it's easy to show up when people search something like "Custom homes in Silverleaf".

    Hey Tim,
    
    I appreciate that you have specific communities listed on your homepage. I just took a screenshot of that section for my web design swipe file. It’s such a great move because communities rarely invest in SEO, so it's easy to show up when people search something like "Custom homes in Silverleaf”

    Subject: Thoughts, Tim?
    
    Hello Tim,
    
    I help custom builders use marketing to grow a company that’s trusted, respected, and built to last.
    
    I’m looking for 15-20 minutes next week in order to introduce myself and get aligned with your growth goals moving forward. Do either of the following dates work?
    
    - **[Date + Time]**

    Let me know what works best, and I’ll get the invite sent your way.
    
    Thanks in advance,

    Not Another Agency Pitch
    
    Hi Tim,
    
    This isn’t another agency pitch. Actually, here’s why you shouldn’t hire an agency right now:
    
    Most builders your size go with agencies that do a little of everything—but not enough of what actually moves the needle. One wrong marketing move hurts your brand, and agencies rarely understand the nuance of your process, your clients, or your market.
    
    To really grow, you need a lean marketing machine:
    • A few proven specialists who know your industry
    • A clear strategy around your main sources of jobs
    • And eventually, someone internal to manage it all
    
    That’s what I help builders put in place—without locking you into a bloated team or burning your whole budget on a retainer.
