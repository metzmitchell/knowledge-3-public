# Lead Magnet Notes & Ideas
Hey bob,

Do you want a personal podcast about the housing economy and Bob Co's marketing?

Free for you, about $60 for me.

We'll do a mini marketing audit of Bob Co and tie it to several industry reports and some of my personal custom home marketing strategies. You'll get a written report and a 15 minute podcast to listen to on your drive home. It's generated by me, my team, and AI (with lots of accurately cited sources).

Worst case, you're entertained...

Interested?

## Other Ideas

Maybe I have Cursor generate a market positioning Overview 

- The landing page is the value prop, description, etc.
    - Enter your email and website URL
        - Optionally enter anything that you want to particular focus on or any questions you have.
    - Below that are example market positioning overviews that I have generated for very large companies
- It outputs some sort of presentation, whether that is a Notion document or an actual deployed website web page.
- And then it emails them the market positioning thing.
- I can do this manually at first.
- subdomain launch: positioning.rowan.build/builder-name

- Cold Email Lead Magnet
    
    Package & homogenize prompts
    
    will generate and send the first 200 emails for you

    - This is a good starting point for companies that serve builders nationally

## Message to Kevin:

**I think you'll say**

- Prioritize output,
    - 100% agree, and see a lot of cognitive biases in the way of this
    - Make short simple bite-sized concepts
        - I also want to do deep dives because that's what I consume
            - maybe that's because I'm not my ICP?
        - Condensing value takes more effort than just shooting and posting
        - Make 2-minute reads, then can piece them together with AI
- Look at Kevin's existing content and repurpose those ideas for builders
    - I want to prioritize Youtube in the format, blog just compliments embedded videos
    - I want to make content about the AI stuff I'm doing
    - I don't exude confidence when simply talking strategy
- Validate before I build anything (response to automation ideas, below)
    - I can build an audit automation in the time it would take me to generate 3 AI audits
    - I want to learn AI automation

**I'm planning to start lead magnets that I can also use to create content**

- Market positioning, ad audit, and SEO audit
    - Content Examples:
        - Top builders in Phoenix, according to Google, ChatGPT, etc.
        - AI scrapes builder ads and puts together a report for me, what are the best ads, common themes, etc.
        - Dive into what they're doing well
        - Can be consistent, repeatable, iterative
        - Will people be upset when I don't pick them as best, or when I scrape and talk about their ads?
    - Automated Lead Magnet:
        - The landing page is the value prop, description, etc.
            - Enter your email and website URL any questions you have
            - Below are example market positioning overviews that I have generated for very large companies
            - It emails them a report
        - Market positioning flow: URL > Perplexity market research > firecrawl scraping website & socials with screenshots > AI market positioning report generated
        - I think Crawl4AI is the best crawler - and it’s open source.
    - As I build other lead magnets automations, they can be folded in to this: SEO audit, ad review, etc.
    - I ~~can create content about the automations as well~~
    - These all add value to my client onboarding process
