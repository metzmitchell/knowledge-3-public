## 5/27/25

Shift in SEO landscape

Continue to put out quality content

Google market share - struggling, still shipping new features

- Make sure you’re using video - SEO vide too(?)
- Craft content around what people are searching for based on Q&A

Be active on Reddit

Email - what regularity on welcome series

Bring brand to life - brand marketing

Bootcamp Digital - schedule meeting after each class

# 4/16/25

Mitch’s departure

Share docs

Builder Marketer Online Groups

- I'm on the lookout for other builder marketer groups or communities like this.
- I have checked out the one from Do You Convert, and it's not what I was hoping for.
- I'm also thinking of joining the National Sales & Marketing Council

Pick next meeting time

Open discussion about problems or things you’re working on

Decide next month's topic

# 2/19/25

Sat with 6 architects and realtors and pitched, and they pitched back to them. Came up with the referral program.

Was that one meeting?

Try to send ou the drip campaign every few months

13 meetings with people

Owner, precon mgr, architect, claire has presentation that she gives architect. Leave a magazine of contacts that he can use.

Card of all locations they’ve built in the past

Mag Cloud to print magazine.

CRM changed to Method Marketing

Robison Home Builders

White Wolf Homes - had an influencer do a tour of a house. She gives idea and does the editing

# 1/15/25

Builder specific vs. CMS

- One of biggest disadvantages is you’re stuck using that company
    - Other people don’t know how to update it
    - Plugins aren’t always useful for it
- Why do people use it?

Everything in homebuilding is a custom approach

Does he recommend a maintenance plan?

Images

- Don’t need any images that are larger than 1920 on the longest side
- Softwares: Image optimization & conversion
    - Images have a lot of metadata. Remove this
    - File format: .webp
    - Use plugins in the website to set maximum size and format.
    - Image lean is the plugin they use. $10/mo Hosted image solution, so our hosting will
    - CDN helps
    - Other plugin: Optimole. $40/mo This will compress the images and host the images. It will serve images based on what device people are on
    - Some CDNs aren’t only core site files
- Builder websites can end up just as a junk drawer

Good idea to get someone who offers content updates on an ongoing basis

Google Business Page

- Put home plans in as a product

# 11/20 Meeting Notes

If I purchase a list, and it gets reported as spam, how is it different on JangoMail vs something like instant.ly

10,000 emails would be $50

Send throttling - send emails in smaller amounts instead of one bulk send

Make sure to have a dedicated IP address when sending emails for higher volume - over 20k/mo probably

DNS setup is most important

SPF record approves the IP address saying this is actually you

Dkim has an encryption key - and says this is the person sending the email

Dmark record is “basically the cherry on top

Avoid trigger words - buy now sales now

Maybe there’s a tool to assess trigger words

Send realtor emails out on Friday at noon knowing their biggest time of the week to work is over the weekend

# 10/16 Meeting Notes

The Builder Newsletter - a company that does newsletters for builders

Top Builder Solutions - another newsletter provider

Wordpress best practices - with Steve

- Send specific questions

Best practices for email marketing campaigns

There are tools you can use for the conversion from Squarespace to wordpress

Divi doesn’t transfer to elementor well

Shelley has tools for managing communities and uploading homes and stuff

Shelley uses Jangomail for their email

Get contact lists from our trade partners

Jangomail does email list hygiene

Mika - Dave is their CRM - making Builder Playbook CRM tool to integrate with Buildertrend

Buildertrend has a CRM - they have the contact form

“Builder Playbook”

leadtracker.lidaconstruction.ca

Mika uses Buildertrend, but they built that mini version that integrates with it

Shelley going to IBS

Colorado Springs HBA - 2 years in a row of major forest fires

- Unlikely natural disaster
- A lot of education for the builders
- Have all kinds of programs established

Bella virtual staging - check out

# 9/18 Meeting Notes

Best paid ads - is it Google FB

Google ads need to be a really refined campaign

Pick 1 goal & put all money into that one goal until you see progress there

- If you do remodels and custom homes, pick one and get it successful first

Quality of landing page matters

Share some analytics screenshots of Google Ads inbound traffic

AI optimization impacting lower ticket items because they have way more conversions to optimize for.

When you have a lead come in, is it linked to a CRM in the back end? Lead could convert months later.

Have good alignment with landing page

Landing page matters a lot

Lead magnet for social campaigns

A resource for gathering information for their remodel that they could put together for their remodel firm

Builder Lead Converter is taking a long time

- Bring a person from that company into this meeting
- Mika created Guide to building a house
- Have a 3rd lead magnet that is a floorplan

Next Month: Shelley

Pinterest ads are under Google Ads now

# 8/21 Meeting Notes

Talk about this month’s topic:

- Toss out a brief discussion on any experience others may have with doing paid marketing with Houzz. Shelley is considering it and I would love to hear if anyone has feedback on how it has worked, value, etc.
- We decided to talk about key marketing assets, like books and sales brochures. Please come ready to share and discuss. Here are some prompts for the direction:
    - How do you go through the brochure or sales presentation with clients?
    - Talk about the book strategy in general.
    - Important brochure content repurposed in multiple places like social or web.
    - Just go through the brochure to get ideas for updates.
- In [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1myA8namMKRU4TmQHDEYZ5T7_SpoeAMg3), I've shared a PDF of our book and brochure, feel free to add any of your materials there if you think it would be helpful.

What if I have someone join to talk about something - McKenzie Paid Ads? Local marketing?

Magazine funnel

Mailer campaigns

Peterson Builders - add
