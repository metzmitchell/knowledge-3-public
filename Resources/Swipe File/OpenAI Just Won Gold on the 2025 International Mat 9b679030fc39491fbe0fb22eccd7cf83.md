# OpenAI Just Won Gold on the 2025 International Math Olympiad — BIGGEST AI NEWS ALL YEAR! - YouTube - David Shapiro
When you have a general purpose technology like this, you're often not going to see

06:58
the direct impact. So, as an example, a general purpose technology, the most famous one is electricity. When electricity was first invented, a lot of people said, "What can you use this for?" It took a while to even invent the electric light bulb to say, "Hey, look,

07:13
now we have a use for this thing." Uh, electric motors took even longer to invent and so on and so forth. So, gener general purpose technologies take a while to really proliferate out and saturate. This is called technological diffusion, but also there's uh there's

07:26
network effects and there's all kinds of things, but basically we're still finding new uses for electricity. Likewise, we're still finding new uses for transformers. So when a technology like a general purpose technology has internal improvements which this is an example of an internal

07:42
improvement of uh then it expands its capabilities and so this is where you start to activate those network effects where up until now one of the best things that generative AI was good for was generating images. This this image is very obviously uh uh AI gen uh AI

07:57
generated. It can generate images. It can generate text. It can generate music which are individual artifacts. I can write some code, those sorts of things. But most of it is either textbased or multimedia based. However, now that it is getting close to saturating math,

08:12
math underscores and undergirds literally all of STEM. So if you're not familiar, STEM means science, technology, uh, engineering, and math. If you want to talk in first principles, first principles is always math. Uh, which means if you can master math, you can master things like quantum mechanics

08:29
and high energy physics and those sorts of things. When Sam Alman and others say you know AI will be able to invent new physics or discover new physics what you're talking about is theory and in physics theory is almost entirely math. Now obviously you also need physical

08:46
experiments you know LIGO is not just math and LIGO is the laser interferometer gravitational observatory. So that's where we were able to detect gravitational waves. you do need big expensive uh experiments but those experiments generate huge huge huge volumes of math uh same as the LHC

09:04
it generates something like many terabytes of of data per second of operation and how do you munchge that data with a lot of math so another thing another downstream consequence of AI getting better at math is what is AI it's linear algebra and matrix multiplication it's all math all of the

09:22
algorithmic research that's going on all the architectural research, all the reinforcement learning, fundamentally at a at a rudimentary level, it is all math. So as these models get better and better at math, it'll do the same thing to math that AI has already done to

09:36
coding, which means that it raises the floor. So, I was talking with my wife this morning and one example is that when you have a technology that raises the the the basement basically or raises the bottom floor with coding, you can learn to code basically as good as a

09:53
5-year veteran in just a few weeks now with the help of artificial intelligence. You can learn coding, you can learn learn cyber security, you can learn all kinds of things. Now that it's getting this good at math, you basically are going to have someone, everyone is

10:07
going to have a PhD level mathematician in their pocket that can help them with anything mathreated. So, first what you're going to see is this huge broadening, this proliferation of math capability in the same way that we've seen lots of people learn writing and learn coding with the help of AI. Now
