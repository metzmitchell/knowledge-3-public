# Copy Notes
- Chunking up and down.
    - Maybe they only care about the outcome: Chunk up
        - Be very clear about what they get and follow up with past outcomes.
    - Maybe they only care about the method because everyone's selves lead to the same outcome.
        - What is your cool technique or mechanism that differentiates you?
- Generally accepted outbound principles
    - Subject: Something a colleague or customer would send
    - First line: relevant reason to reach out.
    - Second line: Poke the bear or value proposition.
    - Third line: Something you did in the past.
    - Fourth line, a call to action.
    - Fifth line may be a P.S.
- A good PS line is for local businesses. Have you tried ___ local restaurant?
- I just called (insert business number), but wanted to reach out via email as well since that’s probably easier for you.
- “Just respond yes if interested”
- Don’t thread all emails together - just 2. Don’t remind them you’re the person they ignored
- Ask for 30 minutes. The duration of a meeting doesn’t change response rates

# Lead Gen Jay’s approach

Personalized first line

Login ot Apollo, VA adds the first line

Don’t start with a basic compliment

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCb4OOpZA70)

Value opener

- Exact problem of theirs and how to solve it
- Clear problem, exact consequence, how you can help

Competitors

- Your competitor is doing ___ really well. (use real data) I looked at their strategy and here’s what they’re doing differently from you.

The Pattern Break Opener

- This isn’t another agency pitch. In fact, I’m going to tell you why you shouldn’t hire an agency right now.
- Break down why
    - You need to nail your customer acquisition cost first. From analyzing your ads account, it looks like you’re paying 3x the industry average per lead. An agency would just burn through your budget faster. Here’s what you need to do first.
- The research-based opener
    - I analyzed 50 B2B Saas companies in your price range and 47 of them are using exit-intent pop-ups with demo offers, averaging 27% more bookings. But when I visited your site, I noticed you’re missing this. Here’s the revenue impact.
    - After analyzing 25 companies in your niche, I noticed that 23 are using retargeting campaigns for abandoned carts. Your store is missing this. Based on your current traffic, that’s roughly $31,000 in monthly revenue you’re leaving on the table.

The question that sells

- Are you open to a different approach to getting b2b leads that doesn’t require spending thousands on linkedin ads?

# Connor Murray Approach

[Article](https://fidforward.com/blog/talent/step_by_step_guide_to_cold_email_in_2025/)

Use strong assumptive language. Imply that a meeting will be taking place, rather than asking if they have time

Deliver a value statement - Why why what

- Who you are
- Why you’re important & relevant to them
- State (don’t ask) that you’re looking to get aligned going forward

Less is more - reduce fluff

- Take off the intro line. No “I hope all is well”

Eliminate optional sounding language

Sound like a human - don’t use a bunch of marketing language

## Examples

My name is Mitch Metz. I do this for things you want

I’m looking for 15-20 minutes next week in order to introduce myself and get aligned with any of your priorities in these areas going forward. Do either of the following dates work?

Date

Date

Please let me know what works best, and I will send us the invite!

Thanks in advance,

Mitch Metz

Hi __,

Who I am

Why I’m reaching out

What we solve, how we solve it

Do they have availability

## Specific Language

Optional language implies that they don’t have an obligation to even respond

### Avoid:

### Optional language Checklist

- I was hoping to
- I’d love to / I’d like to
- If you are interested / available
- How we could potentially help / act as a resource
- Would you be interested
- When you may have time
- Do you possibly have time
- Would you be open to…

### Buzz Word / Phrase checklist

- “See how we can be an Educational Resource”
- “Learn more about your (role, company, etc)”
- “to better understand your role”
- “Give a high level overview”
- “Gain some insight / share some insights”
- Broad Industry Statistics that aren’t relevant to them personally
- Telling them about an article you read
- Cheesy hook lines: “Not since the introduction of the assembly line”
    
    has manufacturing been subject to such profound change!”
    
- Excessive language – “Ever changing landscape”, “During these
    
    Transformative times”, “Empowering businesses”, etc
    
- Nobody wants a high level overview of your solution. They’re tired of that in sales calls.

### Assumptive replacements:

- I am looking to set some time this week to…
- Let’s set some time this week to…
- Either way, I am looking to…
- Let me know if either of those times work
- Looking forward to getting connected

## Goal of a Follow-Up

Don’t send another long email. Don’t give them more stuff. It dilutes the value of the first message and says it’s okay that they didn’t respond.

Don’t make it sound like it’s okay that they didn’t respond. That makes it sound optional.

Just break them out of their routine to get them to respond.

Mindset is “come on - just respond”

Telling people to read your original message

Best line is “please give me your response on this” nothing else - no signature

Send follow-ups every other day at latest. Send emails first thing in the morning.

Follow-up 1:

Hi, just following up on my previous message. Are you available on either of those dates? Let me know when would work best.

Thanks in advance

Mitch Metz

Follow-up 2:

Hi,

Please give me your thoughts on this.

Follow-up 3:

Hi first name,

Let me know if this is a conversation we should postpone for a later date? Perhaps early December? Let me know.

## Process

Break up lists by category

Industry, department/title,
