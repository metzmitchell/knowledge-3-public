## Research a City

- City Research

Conduct a deep research report on the current construction trends and market dynamics in this city, focusing on how they affect small custom home builders with 4–12 employees who do both custom homes and renovations, and want to move upmarket into higher-margin luxury work.

Include the following insights:

1. **Luxury Market Demand:** Is there active demand for high-end custom homes? What’s driving it (e.g., retirement migration, second homes, wealthy professionals, remote workers)?
2. **Labor Availability:** Is there a labor shortage in skilled trades? How are local builders adapting to it?
3. **New Home Construction:** What do recent trends in permits, housing starts, or home values suggest about the pace and scale of new construction?
4. **High-End Renovation Market:** Are homeowners investing in major renovations instead of building new? How strong is the remodeling market?
5. **Migration & Demographics:** Are high-income individuals or families moving in? Are there specific industries or wealth centers (e.g., healthcare, tech, finance) creating a customer base for high-end residential work?

If there’s little or no high-end demand in the city, explain why — and highlight any other notable trends (e.g., emerging commercial work, multifamily growth, or niche remodeling opportunities) that might affect small builders.

Mention how builders are adapting locally, with a few light examples if available.

## Not using (competitor insight)

**Goal:** Determine which residential construction company wields the greatest influence in {{city}}’s high‑end custom‑home market and wins the most luxury projects.

Instructions:

1. Compile a list of **3-5 notable builders** active in custom, luxury, or substantial renovation work. Include hybrid remodel / design‑build firms if they regularly land projects in the upper price tier.
2. For each builder capture:
    
    • **Company Name**
    
    • **Website**
    
    • **Primary Specialty** (custom homes, large‑scale renovations, spec luxury, design‑build, etc.)
    
    • **Target Market**  & location (HNW primary residences, second‑home buyers, retirees, physicians/tech execs, etc.)
    
    • **Company Size Estimate** (employees or annual project volume)
    
    • **Positioning / USP** (architectural style, sustainable focus, turnkey service, awards, etc.)
    
    • **Marketing & Influence Signals** – cite concrete evidence such as:
    
    – Awards & recognitions (NAHB, Houzz Best of, local design awards)
    
    – Media features (magazines, TV, influencer collaborations)
    
    – Partnerships (architects, luxury developers, interior designers)
    
    – Social proof (Instagram follower count, engagement, project photography quality)
    
    – Community or industry leadership roles (association boards, charity builds)
    
3. **Rank the builders by market influence**, using a short justification (1–2 sentences each) that references the strongest signals above.
4. **Highlight the #1 most influential builder** with a brief paragraph explaining *why* they lead the pack—link it to their project mix, brand presence, or partnerships.
5. If the city lacks true luxury builders, explain which segment dominates (volume, production, developer‑led) and how boutique firms carve out niches—or why they struggle.
- Insight Generation

Using the three sources below, and your research

1. List of top custom/high‑end builders in this region

2. Current economic & construction trends for the region

3. U.S. housing & economic forecasts

Step 1 – Identify the most prominent high‑end custom builder in the region

Step 2 – Extract every recent strategic action this builder has taken (hiring, service shifts, pricing changes, marketing pivots, partnerships, technology adoption, etc.). For each action capture:

• What they did

• Date or timeframe

• Evidence with citation (article title, report, press release, web page)

Step 3 – Rank those actions by **potential impact on profitability or market positioning** in the current economic climate. Briefly justify the ranking with data points from sources 2 and 3.

Step 4 – **Select the single most compelling action (the top‑ranked one).**

Step 5 – Deep‑dive on that action only:

• Why it is especially powerful in light of local & national trends (include specific stats with citations).

• Early results or leading indicators (if any).

• Risks or assumptions behind the move.

• Concrete takeaway a 4‑ to 12‑person custom builder could apply.

Output format:

1. **Headline of the compelling move**

2. Short paragraph (≤ 120 words) explaining why it matters, with in‑line citations.

3. Bullet list of supporting data (each bullet ends with citation).

4. “Lesson for Smaller Builders” – three concise actionable points.

Be laser‑focused, data‑driven, and omit everything that is not directly relevant to the selected move. If any information is inferred, clearly label it “(inferred)”.

- Final First Line

**Generate a scroll‑stopping first line (Lead Gen Jay style) with hard data & citation**

Write 2 sentence concise, insight‑driven (30 words max) that you would place as the opening line of a cold email to a high‑end custom builder.

Use the included context about the builder.

1. **Start with a specific strategic move** their top local competitor just made.
2. **Quote one exact metric** tied to that move.
3. **Link the move to one local trend** (include a numeric data point or percentage).
4. **Link the move to one national housing trend** (include a numeric data point or percentage if possible).
5. **End with a forward‑looking takeaway** that hints at what the reader could learn or do next—no pitch.

**Writing notes:**

**Mention a citation or two. Focus on high-authority sources.**

Sound human, write like Lead Gen Jay, with slightly casual language, like one colleague is emailing another.

This section should tie into and work with the next section. Here’s the whole email:

{{First section you write}}

The economy is rough, but {{Builder}} can handle it. Your biggest competitors are just looking at the data and adjusting before you.

I can send you a short personal podcast covering how your positioning relates to economic data from the NAHB and my research about {{Builder’s City}} and the surrounding areas.

**Example of the desired output**

“Scottsdale’s XYZ Builders boosted luxury remodel revenue 18 % by adding an aging‑in‑place division—mirroring a 6.2 % jump in the local 55+ population and a 14 % national drop in speculative starts according to the NAHB 2025 outlook—proof that proactive pivots can secure market share in Phoenix too.”
