# Custom Home Market Analysis: Phoenix and Surrounding Areas, May 2025

Builder confidence edged up to 40 in April 2025, showing modest market improvement despite ongoing affordability challenges in the Phoenix metro area. This analysis focuses on opportunities for custom builders with $5-15M annual revenue.

## Macro & Local Trend Snapshot

- Builder confidence for newly built single-family homes reached 40 in April 2025, up one point from March, with current sales conditions rising two points to 45[5](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/housing-economics/indices/housing-market-index).
- 29% of builders cut home prices in April 2025 (unchanged from March), with an average price reduction of 5%[5](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/housing-economics/indices/housing-market-index).
- Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale saw 26,296 single-family permits issued through October 2024, representing a dramatic 29% year-over-year increase[7](https://www.nahb.org/blog/2024/12/single-family-permits-up-in-october-2024).
- The Phoenix metro housing opportunity index dropped to 21.70 in Q4 2023 (down from 24.90 in Q3), meaning only about 22% of homes were affordable to median-income families[15](https://ycharts.com/indicators/nahbwells_fargo_phoenix_mesa_chandler_az_housing_opportunity_index).
- Maricopa County remained the nation's fastest-growing county, adding 56,831 residents between July 2021 and June 2022, primarily through domestic migration[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).
- Single-family permits were up across all four regions YTD ending October 2024, with the West showing the strongest growth at 13.6%[7](https://www.nahb.org/blog/2024/12/single-family-permits-up-in-october-2024).
- 61% of builders used sales incentives in April 2025, up from 59% in March, indicating continued competition for buyers[5](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/housing-economics/indices/housing-market-index).

## Competitive Landscape

- **Regal American Homes** – Arizona's premier luxury custom builder offering bespoke designs with emphasis on transparency, efficiency, and craftsmanship; rated 4.6/5 on Google Reviews for construction quality and timeline adherence[10](https://www.thephoenixreview.com/top-new-home-builders-phoenix/).
- **Cachet Homes** – Established in 1990, ranked #1 in Arizona's 2024 homebuilder rankings, offering attached, detached, and custom homes with award-winning architectural treatments[16](https://azbigmedia.com/real-estate/ranking-arizona-top-10-home-builders-for-2024/).
- **Fulton Homes** – Ranked #2 in Arizona's 2024 homebuilder rankings, offering semi-custom options at various price points[16](https://azbigmedia.com/real-estate/ranking-arizona-top-10-home-builders-for-2024/).
- **Taylor Morrison** – Ranked #3 in Arizona's 2024 homebuilder rankings, with a mix of production and custom offerings[16](https://azbigmedia.com/real-estate/ranking-arizona-top-10-home-builders-for-2024/).

## Demand Drivers & Customer Segments

- California transplants represent 20-25% of Phoenix metro's new residents, seeking lower home prices and cost of living[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).
- Young professionals in technology, engineering, and insurance sectors are increasingly calling Maricopa County home, drawn by job opportunities[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).
- Domestic migration forms the largest component of Maricopa County's population growth, with only 7,806 of 56,831 new residents in 2021-2022 attributed to natural change[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).
- Population growth is distributed throughout Maricopa County rather than concentrated in specific areas[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).

## Areas of Opportunity for $5-15M Firms

- **Permit Expedition Services** – Phoenix permits are only issued when structures conform to building codes; smaller custom builders can differentiate by offering permit expedition as a value-add service[2](https://www.scoutservices.com/resources/blog/unsure-how-to-meet-the-criteria-for-phoenix-permits-learn-the-ins-and-outs-here/).
- **2018 Code Expertise** – The City of Maricopa's adoption of the 2018 International Building Codes creates opportunity for builders who demonstrate mastery of these standards[4](https://www.maricopa-az.gov/departments/development-services/building-safety).
- **Online Permit Navigation** – Maricopa County launched a new Permit Center in June 2024; builders who master this system gain efficiency advantages over competitors[14](https://www.maricopa.gov/6003/Maricopa-Countys-New-Permit-Center).
- **Premium Infill Development** – With 29% of builders cutting prices nationally, custom builders can focus on premium infill locations where land value better supports custom pricing[5](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/housing-economics/indices/housing-market-index).

## Risks & Headwinds

- Rising competition with 29% YOY increase in Phoenix-area permits could saturate the market and compress margins[7](https://www.nahb.org/blog/2024/12/single-family-permits-up-in-october-2024).
- Affordability challenges with the housing opportunity index at only 21.70 in Q4 2023 limit the potential buyer pool[15](https://ycharts.com/indicators/nahbwells_fargo_phoenix_mesa_chandler_az_housing_opportunity_index).
- Elevated interest rates and policy uncertainty continue to affect buyer psychology and purchasing power[6](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/03/housing-starts-up-in-february-as-builders-still-contend-with-rising-costs).
- Challenging financing conditions could impact cash flow for smaller builders with limited capital reserves[6](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/03/housing-starts-up-in-february-as-builders-still-contend-with-rising-costs).
- Tariff uncertainty could increase material costs and create supply chain disruptions[6](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/03/housing-starts-up-in-february-as-builders-still-contend-with-rising-costs).

## Recommended Next Steps

- Develop relationships with plan review specialists who understand the nuances of the permit process in Phoenix[2](https://www.scoutservices.com/resources/blog/unsure-how-to-meet-the-criteria-for-phoenix-permits-learn-the-ins-and-outs-here/).
- Create targeted marketing campaigns for California transplants who make up 20-25% of new Phoenix residents[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).
- Focus on communities attractive to tech and engineering professionals, who represent a growing demographic in the area[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).
- Consider joint ventures with established local builders to share risk and expand capacity within the $5-15M revenue range[16](https://azbigmedia.com/real-estate/ranking-arizona-top-10-home-builders-for-2024/).
- Emphasize energy efficiency and modern design elements that appeal to younger professionals relocating to the area[9](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/03/30/maricopa-county-population-growth-leader-census/).

# **IBS Presentation in Feb. 2025: Construction Economic Outlook Report: Navigating 2025 and Beyond**

**Executive Summary:**

The construction industry in 2025 faces a complex economic landscape characterized by moderate growth, persistent inflation, and fluctuating interest rates. While a recession is not anticipated, the market is shifting towards a more balanced state, with increased inventory and evolving consumer demands. This report synthesizes insights from the 2025 International Builders Show (IBS) Economic Outlook sessions to provide a detailed overview of the current market, key challenges and opportunities, regional variations, and a special focus on the luxury construction sector. Experts emphasize the importance of adaptability, cost management, technology adoption, and a focus on customer experience to navigate the evolving market and achieve success in 2025 and beyond. Remodeling is highlighted as a particularly strong segment, outpacing new construction in growth potential.

**1. Macroeconomic Context:**

The global and U.S. economies in 2025 are experiencing a period of moderation following the rapid recovery from the pandemic.

- **GDP Growth:** While 2024 saw robust GDP growth around 2.8%, forecasts for 2025 anticipate a moderation to the 1.5% to 2% range. Experts suggest that the Federal Reserve has achieved a "soft landing," avoiding a recession, but growth is expected to be slower than the previous year.
- **Inflation:** Inflation remains a concern, although it has moderated from its peak. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to remain above the Federal Reserve's target of 2% for the foreseeable future. Building material prices have seen significant increases in recent years, with an aggregate rise of approximately 33% since September 2020. Specific materials like concrete, steel, and power transformers have experienced even steeper price hikes. Potential tariffs pose an upside risk to material pricing, particularly for lumber and steel.
- **Interest Rates:** Mortgage rates are projected to remain elevated, although a gradual decrease is anticipated. NAHB projects a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage to reach 6.5% by mid-2025 and potentially fall to 5.9% by the end of 2026. The spread between the 10-year Treasury rate and the 30-year fixed mortgage has widened, partly due to the Federal Reserve's cessation of mortgage-backed securities purchases and quantitative tightening. While interest rate buy-downs remain a popular incentive, their effectiveness is expected to wane over time as the "lock-in effect" of low mortgage rates gradually diminishes.
- **Labor Market:** The labor market is softening but remains relatively tight. The construction industry still faces approximately 200,000 open positions. While overall job growth is positive, some states have not yet recovered jobs lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immigration policy is identified as a significant wild card, with potential impacts on the availability of labor in the construction sector, especially for specific trades heavily reliant on immigrant workers.

**2. Overall Construction Market Outlook:**

The construction market in 2025 is characterized by a shift towards a more balanced market, with varying performance across different segments.

- **Housing Market Balance:** The market is transitioning from a strong seller's market to a more balanced state. Inventory is expected to recover faster than sales, leading to a projected 4.1-month supply of existing homes in 2025 – the highest level since 2016. This points towards a balanced market, although not quite a buyer's market.
- **Inventory:** Active listing counts for existing homes have surged, indicating increased seller participation. New home inventory remains elevated at 8.5 months supply, while resale inventory is lower at 3.1 months. The combined month supply is around 4, suggesting a lean inventory environment nationally, although oversupply exists in certain local markets.
- **Sales:** Existing home sales in 2024 were weak, nearing 30-year lows. However, a modest improvement is anticipated for 2025. New home sales have shown stronger performance, reaching a market share of 14.5% in 2024, the highest since 2005. New home sales are expected to outperform existing home sales in 2025, but will face increased competition from the recovering resale market.
- **Pricing:** Home price growth is slowing. Median listing prices have shown some softening, with a 2.2% decrease in January. However, sales prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace. Asking prices are softening more at the median, while sales prices remain more resilient. Regional pricing power is strongest in the Northeast.
- **New Construction vs. Resale:** New home construction benefits from incentives like mortgage rate buy-downs and move-in ready options. However, as existing home inventory recovers, new construction will face increased competition. Move-in ready inventory in new construction is declining, while "not yet started" remains relatively stable.
- **Single-Family Starts:** Forecasts for single-family housing starts in 2025 are largely flat, with NAHB projecting a slight 0.2% growth. Consensus forecasts range from a 5% decrease to a 5% increase, highlighting uncertainty. Custom home building is expected to remain stable and grow, particularly if the stock market performs well.
- **Multifamily Starts:** Multifamily construction is experiencing a significant decline, with a 25% drop in 2024 and further weakness expected in 2025. A stabilization is anticipated in the latter half of 2025, with starts normalizing below 400,000 per year. Completions are currently outpacing starts in the multifamily sector, indicating a growing inventory.
- **Remodeling:** The remodeling market is highlighted as a strong and growing segment. NAHB forecasts continued positive momentum for remodeling, with nominal growth rates around 7% expected for the end of 2024 and moderating to 3-4% in 2025. Remodeling's share of housing investment is increasing, currently comprising around 43% of the total. Demand factors such as the aging housing stock and longer homeowner tenure are driving growth in remodeling. Remodeling is expected to outpace new home construction in growth in 2025.

**3. Key Challenges and Opportunities:**

The construction industry faces a range of challenges and opportunities in 2025.

- **Margin Compression:** Increased supply from both new and resale markets, coupled with higher interest rates, is leading to margin compression for builders, particularly in the Sunbelt markets. Incentives are being widely used to drive sales, further impacting margins.
- **Affordability:** Housing affordability remains a significant challenge. Homeownership is significantly more expensive than renting in many markets. Entry-level buyers are particularly impacted by affordability constraints. Factors like rising home prices relative to income and elevated mortgage rates contribute to this challenge.
- **Regulatory Burdens:** Regulatory costs continue to represent a significant portion of home prices (around 24%). Builders face challenges from zoning regulations, permitting processes, building codes, and architectural design standards. Deregulation is seen as a potential opportunity to reduce costs and increase housing supply.
- **Tariffs and Trade Policy:** Potential tariffs on building materials from Canada, Mexico, and China pose a threat to material prices and supply chains. Uncertainty surrounding trade policy creates challenges for cost management and planning.
- **Immigration Policy:** Changes in immigration policy and increased enforcement could significantly impact the availability and cost of labor in the construction industry, particularly in regions heavily reliant on immigrant workers.
- **Technology Adoption:** While the construction industry has been slower to adopt technology, there is growing recognition of the potential of automation and AI to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. However, experts caution against hype and emphasize focusing on practical applications of technology to solve specific business problems. Modular construction and 3D printing are seen as potential solutions to labor shortages and cycle time issues, though widespread adoption is still in early stages.
- **Workforce Development:** Addressing the skilled labor shortage is critical for the long-term health of the construction industry. Promoting skilled trades as valuable career paths, investing in vocational training, and partnering with educational institutions are essential strategies.

**4. Regional Market Variations:**

Market conditions vary significantly across different regions of the U.S.

- **Northeast:** The Northeast is identified as a region with pricing power and opportunity. Inventory is lower, and demand is relatively stronger. However, building in the Northeast can be challenging due to regulations and land availability.
- **Sunbelt (Florida, Texas, Arizona):** While these markets experienced strong growth during the pandemic, they are now facing increased inventory, slower sales, and higher incentive usage. Margin compression is a significant concern in these markets. Florida's condo market is particularly soft, and insurance costs are a growing issue.
- **Midwest and Northeast (Green Dots on Zonda Map):** Some parts of the Midwest and Northeast are showing overperforming sales activity, although builders may still perceive the market as challenging due to consumer hesitancy and the need for incentives.
- **Idaho and Utah:** These states are highlighted as leaders in job market growth and home building activity, experiencing significant job growth and strong demand.

**5. Luxury Construction Sector Outlook:**

While not explicitly detailed as a separate sector in the transcripts, insights about the high-end market can be gleaned, providing a basis for a luxury construction outlook.

- **Outperforming Segment:** The high-end market is identified as an outperforming segment within the overall new home market. It is performing significantly better than the entry-level market and even the move-up market. In many top markets, a significant percentage (e.g., 60% in some cases) of the high-end market is considered overperforming.
- **Driver of Sales:** The high-end market is acknowledged as a key driver of reasonable sales numbers in the current environment. This suggests that affluent buyers are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and affordability challenges compared to other buyer segments.
- **Lock-in Effect Less Relevant:** Buyers in the luxury segment are likely less impacted by the mortgage rate "lock-in effect" affecting existing homeowners. They may be more likely to trade up or down regardless of existing mortgage rates due to life changes or investment considerations.
- **Demand Drivers:** While specific drivers for luxury construction are not explicitly detailed, it can be inferred that factors such as wealth accumulation (equity gains since 2019), desire for larger and more customized homes, and potentially investment demand are supporting the high-end market.
- **Risks:** The report acknowledges the need to understand potential risks that could derail the high-end market. These could include economic downturns impacting high-net-worth individuals, changes in investment sentiment, or shifts in luxury consumer preferences.
- **Custom Building Strength:** Carol Griffith's comments highlight the strength of the custom home market, where builders focus on design, personalized experiences, and high-end features. This segment is less reliant on incentives and more focused on delivering unique value to discerning clients.

**Strategies for Luxury Builders:**

- **Focus on Design and Experience:** Luxury builders should emphasize exceptional design, customization options, and a high-touch, personalized customer experience to justify premium pricing and differentiate themselves.
- **Target Affluent Buyers:** Marketing efforts should be directed towards affluent demographics who are less price-sensitive and prioritize quality, location, and unique features.
- **Embrace Technology for Efficiency and Customization:** Leverage technology to streamline processes, enhance design visualization, and offer highly customized solutions to luxury clients.
- **Manage Costs Strategically:** While discounting is discouraged, luxury builders should still focus on efficient job costing and managing slippage to maintain healthy profit margins, even within premium pricing structures.
- **Build Strong Relationships:** Cultivate strong relationships with high-end clients, architects, designers, and subcontractors to ensure seamless project execution and exceptional quality.
- **Highlight Resiliency and Sustainability:** Luxury buyers are increasingly interested in resilient and sustainable homes. Incorporating advanced building materials and energy-efficient technologies can be a selling point in this segment.

**6. Strategies for Success in 2025:**

Across all segments, experts recommend the following strategies for construction businesses to thrive in 2025:

- **Control Costs:** Implement rigorous job costing, eliminate slippage, and explore automation and labor-saving technologies to manage costs effectively.
- **Avoid Discounts:** Focus on value proposition, customer experience, and sales skills rather than relying on discounts to drive sales.
- **Embrace Technology:** Adopt technology strategically to improve efficiency, enhance marketing and sales, and address labor challenges.
- **Focus on Customer Experience:** Provide exceptional customer service, build trust, and manage expectations to create positive experiences and generate referrals.
- **Adapt to Market Shifts:** Be flexible and adaptable to changing market conditions, including inventory levels, interest rates, and consumer preferences.
- **Diversify Services:** Consider expanding into remodeling services to capitalize on the growing remodeling market and diversify revenue streams.
- **Invest in Workforce Development:** Actively participate in workforce development initiatives and promote skilled trades as attractive career options.
- **Monitor Market Trends:** Stay informed about macroeconomic trends, housing market data, regional variations, and policy changes to make informed business decisions.
- **Build Resilient Homes:** Incorporate resilient building practices and materials to address rising insurance costs and meet evolving building codes and consumer demands for safety and durability.

**Conclusion:**

The construction industry in 2025 is poised for a year of moderate growth and significant transformation. While challenges related to affordability, inflation, and labor persist, opportunities exist in the remodeling sector, the high-end market, and through strategic adoption of technology and efficient business practices. Success in this environment will require agility, a focus on value, and a commitment to meeting evolving consumer needs while navigating a complex and dynamic economic landscape. For luxury builders, emphasizing design, personalization, and exceptional service will be key to capitalizing on the resilient high-end market and achieving continued success.

# **U.S. Residential Construction Industry Outlook 2025-2030: Growth Strategies for Custom Home Builders**

The U.S. construction industry is navigating a period of transformation characterized by stabilizing material costs, evolving interest rate environments, and shifting consumer preferences. For a custom home builder and remodeler targeting growth from $10 million to $40 million annual revenue over the next decade, understanding these dynamics is crucial for strategic planning and market positioning.

## **Economic Outlook for Residential Construction**

The U.S. construction market is projected to experience robust growth in the coming years, with significant opportunities in the residential sector. The overall construction market is forecast to grow by 5.6% annually, reaching $1.27 trillion by 2025, and is expected to expand to approximately $1.59 trillion by 2029, with a CAGR of 4.4% from 2025-2029[17](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/23/3066190/0/en/United-States-Construction-Industry-Report-2025-A-1-59-Trillion-Forecasted-Market-by-2029-with-CAGR-of-4-4-During-2025-2029.html). This growth trajectory presents favorable conditions for custom home builders and remodelers aiming to scale their operations.

## **Housing Starts and New Construction Trends**

Housing starts are projected to remain strong through the remainder of the decade, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasting an annual average of 1.68 million starts from 2025 to 2029, significantly above the historical 40-year average of 1.37 million per year[3](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-09/60191-housing-starts.pdf). This robust activity is expected to continue through 2029 before gradually declining in the 2030s as population growth slows.

For single-family construction specifically, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) projects modest growth of 0.2% in 2025 to an annual rate of 1.01 million units, followed by a more substantial 4% increase in 2026 to 1.05 million units[2](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/02/a-slight-rise-in-single-family-starts-as-economic-uncertainty-persists). Additionally, ConstructConnect forecasts stronger growth for single-family construction spending at 13.1% in 2025 and 12.4% in 2026[20](https://www.phcppros.com/articles/20633-2025-construction-outlook).

The multifamily segment is also poised for recovery, with projections indicating an 11% increase in starts by number of units in 2025, following a 10% decline in 2024[4](https://www.enr.com/articles/59779-construction-starts-to-increase-as-interest-rates-fall-dodge-says). ConstructConnect anticipates multifamily construction spending to grow by 9.5% in 2025 and accelerate to 17% in 2026[20](https://www.phcppros.com/articles/20633-2025-construction-outlook).

## **Remodeling Market Expansion**

The remodeling segment represents a particularly promising area for growth-minded builders. NAHB forecasts residential remodeling activity to expand by 5% in 2025 and an additional 3% in 2026[2](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/02/a-slight-rise-in-single-family-starts-as-economic-uncertainty-persists)[14](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/02/remodeling-market-poised-for-growth-in-2025). This aligns with broader market projections that estimate the U.S. residential remodeling market at $527.36 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 4.6% through 2030[6](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-residential-remodeling-market-report).

Several factors are driving this remodeling boom, including:

1. Homeowners' increasing preferences for aesthetically pleasing interiors and exteriors
2. Growing demand for home automation and smart home technology
3. Rising interest in energy-efficient improvements and sustainable building practices
4. Aging housing stock requiring significant updates to meet modern standards

For custom builders with remodeling capabilities, this segment offers steady growth potential, particularly as higher interest rates encourage homeowners to renovate existing properties rather than purchase new homes.

## **Interest Rates and Financial Environment**

## **Interest Rate Projections**

The Federal Reserve has begun its cutting cycle, with significant implications for the construction industry. After reducing the federal funds rate by 100 basis points since September 2024, projections suggest further cuts, bringing the rate to 3.50%-3.75% by the end of 2025 and potentially as low as 2.25%-2.50% by the first half of 2027[15](https://www.morningstar.com/markets/when-will-fed-start-cutting-interest-rates).

Mortgage rates are expected to follow a similar, though not identical, trajectory. NAHB forecasts that mortgage rates will unevenly trend toward 6% by the end of 2026, though this process may include periods where rates move sideways or even increase temporarily[2](https://www.nahb.org/news-and-economics/press-releases/2025/02/a-slight-rise-in-single-family-starts-as-economic-uncertainty-persists).

## **Impact on Construction Activity**

The declining interest rate environment should provide significant tailwinds for residential construction. Lower borrowing costs will:

1. Improve housing affordability for potential homebuyers
2. Release pent-up demand created during the high-rate environment
3. Potentially free up the existing home inventory as homeowners become more willing to sell and purchase new properties
4. Enhance financing conditions for builders seeking construction loans

However, the transition may not be entirely smooth. The market currently has a glut of new homes available (7.3 months of supply), which is on the higher end of historic norms, while the supply of existing homes remains tight at 4.3 months[20](https://www.phcppros.com/articles/20633-2025-construction-outlook). This imbalance could create short-term challenges in certain markets as interest rates decline.

## **Construction Inputs and Cost Factors**

## **Material Price Trends**

After significant volatility in recent years, building material prices are expected to stabilize in 2025, though generally at higher levels than pre-pandemic norms[7](https://www.usp-research.com/insights/blogs/building-materials-trends-for-2024/). Specific materials show varying trends:

- **Structural Steel**: Following a 6.85% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q4 2023, prices are expected to stabilize in 2025 with modest fluctuations[7](https://www.usp-research.com/insights/blogs/building-materials-trends-for-2024/).
- **Copper**: Despite general upward pressure due to ongoing demand, near-term volatility is expected, including a surprising price drop of 10.83% in Q2 2024[7](https://www.usp-research.com/insights/blogs/building-materials-trends-for-2024/).
- **Concrete Block**: A rebound is anticipated in late 2024 and into 2025 as supply chain issues resolve and economic conditions improve[7](https://www.usp-research.com/insights/blogs/building-materials-trends-for-2024/).
- **Lumber**: The lumber market is expected to grow, driven by increasing preference for wood as a building material across various construction sectors and a renewed focus on sustainability[7](https://www.usp-research.com/insights/blogs/building-materials-trends-for-2024/).
- **Aluminum**: Analysts predict an upswing in the aluminum market toward the end of the financial year[7](https://www.usp-research.com/insights/blogs/building-materials-trends-for-2024/).

Global market dynamics, particularly demand volumes in China, will continue to influence material prices throughout 2025 and beyond[7](https://www.usp-research.com/insights/blogs/building-materials-trends-for-2024/). Additionally, while overall inflation is showing signs of cooling, its impact will continue to drive construction material costs higher than pre-pandemic levels.

## **Labor Market Challenges**

The construction labor shortage represents one of the most significant constraints on industry growth. Approximately 70% of construction companies struggle to find sufficient workers, a problem that has worsened since 2020[8](https://abctn.org/construction-labor-shortage/). With over 20% of construction workers over 55 and approaching retirement, and less than 3% of young people considering construction careers, the industry faces a growing demographic challenge[8](https://abctn.org/construction-labor-shortage/).

This shortage has tangible consequences, including:

1. Project delays and extended timelines
2. Increased labor costs and wage pressure
3. Potential quality issues due to stretched workforces
4. Limitations on company capacity and growth potential

For a builder aiming to scale from $10 million to $40 million in revenue, addressing these labor challenges through innovative recruitment, training, and retention strategies will be essential.

## **Regional Growth and Market Segments**

## **North Carolina and Southeast Market Opportunities**

The Southeast region, particularly North Carolina, represents an area of significant opportunity. North Carolina is projected to see a 152% jump in single-family rental inventory, the largest percentage increase among leading states[9](https://www.credaily.com/briefs/build-to-rent-boom-110k-single-family-rentals-underway/). This suggests substantial construction activity and demographic shifts that could benefit custom builders.

The growth in the region aligns with broader migration patterns toward the "sunbelt" states, where people are looking to buy homes in more affordable areas[4](https://www.enr.com/articles/59779-construction-starts-to-increase-as-interest-rates-fall-dodge-says). This demographic shift presents opportunities for custom builders who can address the specific needs of these relocating households.

## **Emerging Housing Types and Market Segments**

Several specialized housing segments show particular promise for growth-oriented builders:

1. **Build-to-Rent (BTR)**: This market is experiencing unprecedented growth, with over 110,000 single-family rental homes currently under construction across the U.S., representing a 53.5% increase in BTR inventory[9](https://www.credaily.com/briefs/build-to-rent-boom-110k-single-family-rentals-underway/). Texas leads with nearly 22,000 units under development, followed by Arizona and Florida with approximately 14,000 units each[9](https://www.credaily.com/briefs/build-to-rent-boom-110k-single-family-rentals-underway/).
2. **Data Centers and Commercial Support**: While not directly residential, data center construction is booming (57% increase in 2024 and a projected 24% rise in 2025), potentially offering diversification opportunities for residential builders looking to expand their portfolio[4](https://www.enr.com/articles/59779-construction-starts-to-increase-as-interest-rates-fall-dodge-says).
3. **High-End Custom Homes**: The luxury and high-end custom segment remains resilient, particularly as high-net-worth individuals continue to invest in premium housing. This segment aligns well with the expertise of quality-focused custom builders.

## **Regulatory and Environmental Considerations**

## **Building Code Evolution**

The implementation of the 2024 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) represents a significant regulatory change affecting residential builders[11](https://www.energycodes.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/2024%20IECC%20Webinar%20-%20Full%20Presentation.pdf). Key components include:

1. Changes to building thermal envelope requirements
2. For the first time, allowances for credit related to HVAC & DHW efficiency and duct location
3. Requirements for 15% energy cost savings for electric homes and 20% for mixed-fuel homes
4. Additional performance requirements for homes larger than 5,000 square feet, which must achieve 5% better performance (20% and 25% respectively)[11](https://www.energycodes.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/2024%20IECC%20Webinar%20-%20Full%20Presentation.pdf)

These code changes will require builders to adapt their construction techniques and potentially invest in new technologies and materials to remain compliant.

## **Sustainability and Green Building Trends**

The remodeling and new construction industries are increasingly influenced by sustainability considerations, including:

1. Home automation systems and smart home technology
2. Improved temperature control and energy efficiency
3. Enhanced sound, vibration, pest, and heat insulation
4. Green building practices and energy conservation measures[6](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/us-residential-remodeling-market-report)

For custom builders, positioning themselves at the forefront of these sustainability trends can create competitive advantages and open new market segments.

## **Strategic Growth Pathways: $10M to $40M**

## **Business Models for Successful Scaling**

The residential construction industry presents unique challenges for scaling operations. Due to low barriers to entry, volatile business cycles, and local market dynamics, successful growth typically requires a strategic approach. Companies that have successfully scaled from $10 million to $40 million annual revenue typically employ a combination of strategies:

1. **Organic Growth**: Expanding operations incrementally through increased marketing, additional crews, and wider geographic reach[16](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/w14-2_will.pdf).
2. **Vertical Integration**: Bringing previously outsourced functions in-house to improve quality control, reduce costs, and enhance scheduling reliability[16](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/w14-2_will.pdf).
3. **Strategic Partnerships**: Forming alliances with nationally known manufacturing and retail brands, franchisors, or outside investors to accelerate growth and expand market reach[16](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/w14-2_will.pdf).

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to achieving scale in the home building and remodeling industry. Successful companies often employ multiple business strategies simultaneously or sequentially to navigate growth challenges[16](https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/w14-2_will.pdf).

## **Technology and Process Optimization**

Technology adoption represents a critical factor for builders seeking to scale efficiently. Key technological investments should focus on:

1. **Construction Management Software**: Digital tools that ensure consistent material ordering procedures and synchronize project tasks with contractor schedules[12](https://www.buildxact.com/us/blog/scaling-a-construction-business/).
2. **Change Order Management**: Systems that clearly track the impact of change orders on cost and timeline, improving client communication and financial outcomes[12](https://www.buildxact.com/us/blog/scaling-a-construction-business/).
3. **Workforce Management**: Modern construction management software that facilitates maintaining a network of potential employees and quickly posting open positions to address labor challenges[12](https://www.buildxact.com/us/blog/scaling-a-construction-business/).

By systematizing operations through technology, builders can maintain quality and customer satisfaction while increasing volume and revenue.

## **Talent Acquisition and Retention**

Given the industry-wide labor challenges, innovative approaches to talent acquisition and retention are essential for growth. Successful strategies include:

1. Developing and maintaining relationships with trade schools and community colleges
2. Creating structured apprenticeship and training programs
3. Offering competitive compensation packages and growth opportunities
4. Emphasizing company culture and work-life balance to attract younger workers

## **Conclusion: Strategic Implications for Custom Home Builders**

For a custom home builder and remodeler targeting growth from $10 million to $40 million in annual revenue, the 2025-2030 period offers significant opportunities despite challenges. The combination of declining interest rates, strong housing demand, and growing remodeling activity creates favorable conditions for expansion.

Key strategic considerations include:

1. **Market Segment Focus**: Evaluating opportunities in high-growth segments like build-to-rent, luxury custom homes, and major remodeling projects.
2. **Geographic Expansion**: Considering expansion into high-growth regions like North Carolina and other Southeast markets experiencing population influx.
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Investing in technology and standardized processes to support scaling without sacrificing quality or customer satisfaction.
4. **Workforce Development**: Implementing innovative recruitment and retention strategies to address the critical labor shortage challenges.
5. **Regulatory Adaptation**: Staying ahead of code changes and sustainability trends to maintain compliance while leveraging new requirements as differentiation opportunities.
6. **Financial Structure**: Ensuring adequate capitalization and credit facilities to support growth in a shifting interest rate environment.

By addressing these strategic imperatives while maintaining a focus on quality and customer satisfaction, custom home builders can successfully navigate the evolving market landscape and achieve ambitious growth targets through 2030.

# My Beliefs About Unique Marketing Challenges of Custom Builders

**Approaching Marketing for Luxury Custom Builders doing $7 - 20 MM per year**

---

### 1. Re-frame the Rules Before You Spend a Dollar

- **You’re selling a $1–5 MM life-statement, not a SKU.** The buyer’s psychological hurdle is *existential*, so persuasion must feel more like fiduciary guidance than promotion.
- **B2C mechanics, B2B diligence.** Households behave like “micro-enterprises.” Mirror that rigor in proposals and client communication.
- **Cycles outlast tactics.** The prospect may lurk for 18-36 months. Standard funnel metrics (CPL, MQL) break. Instead, track *relationship velocity*—time from first meaningful interaction to design retainer—and *backlog coverage* (months of work secured).
- **Small team ≠ small data.** Automate instrumentation early— Google Sheets is usually enough. Two or three numbers that tie to backlog and margin beat 40 vanity KPIs.

---

### 2. Strategic Pillars That Actually Shift Revenue

| Pillar | Why It Wins in Custom Building | Key Move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Demand *Creation*** | High-net-worth families don’t Google “custom builder” until someone plants the dream. | Architect, realtor, desiger, & wealth-advisor events; private design-inspiration dinners. |
| **Radical Transparency** | Affluent buyers assume builders hide overruns. Showing your math disarms that fear. | Publish anonymized cost-breakdowns, spec sheets, and a live “project weather-map” of schedule risk. |
| **Account-Based Experience (ABX)** | There are only a few hundred qualified households in your market each year. Treat each like an enterprise account. | Build micro-funnels by property parcel: deed transfer alerts → personalized lot-fit study → invite-only site walk. |
| **Brand-as-Local-SEO-Engine** | Google’s leaked API docs proved branded queries and entity authority drive the map pack. | Manufacture *earned mentions*—local media, architect blogs, vendor case studies—to raise brand search volume. |
| **Lifetime Asset Flywheel** | One closing can spin three future jobs (referrals, remodels, caretaker program). | Formalize a “Lifetime Care Club” with seasonal maintenance, then mine that list for referral asks. |

---

### 3. Tactics Most Builders Haven’t Considered

**Use Architect & Interior-Designer CRMs as Lead Aggregators**

- Swap lot-study templates or 3D concept renders for access to their “pending build” pipelines.
- Auto-sync new records into your HubSpot so no prospect slips away.

**Geofenced Private Events, Not Mass Home Shows**

- Rent a mid-build project for one evening; invite only 30 prospects + their advisors, architects, realtors, and/or their designers.
- Capture thermal-camera footage of insulation quality on-site—turns a boring “quality” claim into visible proof.

**Backlog Scarcity Signaling**

- Publish “Next available start date: February 2026” across web headers, Google Business Profile posts, and email footers. Scarcity reframes price objections and filters tire-kickers.

**Wealth-Data Micro-Targeting**

- Buy CoreLogic or WealthEngine segments: primary residence value $1 MM+, lot size >1 acre, equity >60 %.
- Run direct-mail *design lookbooks*—heavy stock, no pricing—followed by LinkedIn Sales Navigator outreach to the head of household (treat them like a CFO).

**Interactive Cost-Range Gates**

- Embed a slider-based pricing tool. Once they self-select a budget tier, route them to a booking page for a paid “Pre-design Workshop.” Keeps the tire-kickers out, funds your pre-sales labor.

**Digital Build Diaries (World-Labs-style 3D)**

- Weekly 3D scans posted behind a secure portal; buyers share with friends → viral effect in wealth circles.
- Re-edit scans into 15-sec reels for Instagram; tag vendors for cross-promotion.

**Google API Insights → Local Entity SEO**

- From the May-2024 leak: topical authority, brand signals, and click success matter more than keyword stuffing.
- Action: syndicate project stories to *luxury home* media, link back with schema-rich JSON-LD citing architect + interior designer entities. You climb without another backlink grind.

**Investor-Grade Project Pro-Forma**

- Package every proposal with IRR on energy savings, Airbnb potential for attached guest suites, and resale comps. Speaks the language of wealth managers who influence the go/no-go.

### 4. Process & Ops Tweaks for a One-Person Marketing Bench

1. **Automate the Mundane**
    - Zapier/GSheets: pull permit filings → trigger personalized “Lot Compatibility Report” email within 10 min.
2. **Weekly Cadence**
    - Monday: backlog & pipeline check, update Mini kpi Dashboard.
    - Wednesday: ABX outreach sprint (5 architect check-ins, 5 HNW prospects).
    - Friday: Content atomization—turn site-walk video into six short-form posts.
3. **Shared Source-of-Truth**
    - Notion board with *>* toggles for Projects, Ideas, Deferred.
4. **Strategic Slack Channel with Owners**
    - #market-intel: drop competitor wins/losses, Zillow land alerts, architect awards. Keeps leadership invested in marketing without extra meetings.

---

### 5. Metrics That Matter (and Nothing Else)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backlog Months | ≥ 12-15 | Predicts cash-flow; reduces panic discounting. |
| Relationship Velocity | ≤ 120 days to design retainer | Compresses the longest controllable phase. |
| Avg. Gross Margin per Project | Trend ↑ 2-3 pts YoY | Marketing should amplify pricing power. |
| Referral Ratio | ≥ 50 % of signed contracts | Proves delight flywheel is spinning. |
| Entity Search Volume | +20 % YoY | Proxy for brand authority post-SEO initiatives. |

---

### 6. Competitive Edges I’ve Flagged from Our Past Work

- **Builder Marketer Peer Community:** Position yourself as the *only* builder in your market using insights from the Rowan Builder Marketing collective—access to process SOPs most competitors will learn two years late.
- **Google Local SEO Leak Exploitation:** You already know how to tune *brand entity signals* (reviews cadence, media coverage loops). Few regional builders have even heard of the leak.
- **AI-Enhanced Visuals:** World-Labs-style 3D + photorealistic renders created overnight. Speeds decision-cycles, reduces costly re-designs.
- **Lifetime Care Program (Custom Care Specialist playbook):** Turns warranty expense into a revenue stream *and* referral engine.
- **Data-Light KPI Sheet:** The simplified CLV ↔ AAC model —leadership loves it because it speaks profit, not marketing jargon.

---

### 7. Immediate Next Steps You Can Steal

1. **Draft a 12-month Content Calendar around “Transparency”**—cost breakdown posts, supply-chain spotlights, and weekly site diaries.
2. **Build the Backlog Scarcity Widget**—auto-updates via Google Sheets; embed in header.
3. **Spin Up Architect Roundtables**—quarterly Zooms recorded, clipped, published. Doubles as both networking and content.
4. **Ship the Interactive Pricing Gate**—pilot with one service line; measure booked workshops within 30 days.
5. **Audit Brand Entity Health**—run through GBP, schema, local media mentions; plan a 90-day sprint to plug gaps.

---

**Bottom line:** Marketing a $2 MM custom home is closer to courting an enterprise account than running an ecommerce funnel. The firms that win aren’t louder—they’re *more precise*, *more transparent*, and *relentlessly systematic* about nurturing the handful of households who matter. Everything above is geared to help you do just that.
