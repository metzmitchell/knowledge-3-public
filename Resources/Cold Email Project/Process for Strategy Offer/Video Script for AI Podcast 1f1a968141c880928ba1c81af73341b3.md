# Video Script for AI Podcast
Hello, you can go forward 15 seconds to skip this intro

This podcast will speak to your company directly. It will incorporate information that I have purchased from the National Association of Home builders, and learned from attending conferences like the International Builders Show - so it’s not all just information that’s widely available. Most importantly, it will apply that information to your specific company and regional trends.

As a disclaimer, My team put this together for you using a variety of AI tools. It’s still super valuable, but take it with a grain of salt.

The AI is great at maintaining the accuracy of actual economic reports, and clearly citing sources, but I’ve found there can be some inaccuracies when I have it research companies like yours - it’s a little more open-ended of a prompt, so it can get sidetracked on maybe a social media account with the same name or something, regardless you should be able to spot those inaccuracies because it’s your company, and it does an exceptional job at accurately citing the economic reports and then tying that back in to your personal strategy.

So that’s my disclaimer

If you are a small or medium sized builder

you want to get more of the right clients

And you want to build a better company for your team and their families

I can help you do so with my company - you’re on our website, so check it out
