# Executive Assistant
- **Email**
    
    # Email Overview
    
    metzassistant@gmail.com
    
    Thisisagreatemailaccount.1
    
    That email account has access to all of my email accounts. Once you're in Gmail, you'll see the option to go to metzmitchell@gmail.com. I have my other 2 email accounts set to send to that.
    
    Sending address:
    
    The sending address is set based on the email that it was sent to. Make sure that it is the correct email signature for that address. This is very important.
    
    I need to use that SFC signature for Living Stone, Atelier, ID.ology, and The Sullivan Family of Companies
    
    Prompt for AI writing style: my tone is casual but professional, succinct, avoids excessive adjectives, 8th grade level of grammar
    
    ## Email Labels
    
    - **0.1 Mitch**: Emails requiring Mitchell’s direct attention quickly
    - **0.2 To Respond:** Emails you will manage but haven’t yet responded to.
    - **0.3 Review**: Not urgent emails requiring Mitchell’s input or approval before proceeding.
    - **0.4 Responded**: Emails you’ve responded to but want Mitchell to review.
    - **0.5 Waiting On**: Emails waiting for input or action from others before they can move forward.
    - **0.6 Receipts/Financials**: Emails related to financial matters (e.g., receipts, invoices).
        - Set up automatic forwarding of receipts where possible
            - Sender address [metzmitchell@gmail.com](mailto:metzmitchell@gmail.com)
            - To [receiptsmitchellmetz@qbodocs.com](mailto:receiptsmitchellmetz@qbodocs.com)
            - Needs to be definitely a receipt. Incorrect receipts cause workflow issues.
    - **0.7 Opt Out: Please opt out any emails added in here & marked as unread**
    - **1.1 Clients**
        - Company Name
            - Create an automatic filter for all emails coming from that domain to add this label
    - **1.2 Freelancers and Agencies**
        - Freelancer name
            - Create an automatic filter for all emails coming from specific freelancers
    - **1.3 Vendors & Advertisers**
        - Company (IE: Laurel of Cashiers)
            - Create an automatic filter for all emails from different vendors.
    - **2.1 Newsletters**: Emails containing content Mitchell wants to read later.
    - **2.2 Cold Emails: Cold emails can be mostly deleted, blocked, or reported as spam. If you’re not sure if it’s a cold pitch, put it in here for review.**
    
    ### Workflow
    
    Email comes into inbox
    
    Moved into a 0._ folder for action to be taken
    
    Additional tags or filters applied or created
    
    Once action is taken, the 0._ label is removed
    
    ## Preferences
    
    ### Classes and Email Lists from Sean
    
    Sean will forward emails that contain several other builders. They will be related to a class that he is teaching, and will often contain the word “roster” somewhere in the email.
    
    They will either contain an attached spreadsheet with the names  or he will have forwarded an email that was sent to over 20 other email addresses.  Add the spreadsheet or email addresses to Constant Contact under the lists titled “builders” and “Sean Builder Class / Course”
    
    ### Uploading Contact List
    
    - First / last name,
    - phone number,
    - email.
    - Address (if it's easy),
    - company ()if it's easy).
    
    Name and email are the only main ones.
