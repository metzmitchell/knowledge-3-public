# Writing Style
This proposal uses a conversational yet professional tone that speaks directly to you ("you" and "I") with contractions and parenthetical asides (like "I'm on the phone a lot") to be approachable, while making it easy to digest with bullet points, bold emphasis, and progressive disclosure. The writing balances being personal and accessible while maintaining business credibility through specific metrics, clear expectations, and professional boundaries.
