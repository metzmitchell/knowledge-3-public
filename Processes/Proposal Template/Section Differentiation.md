# Section Differentiation
(not to be replicated in template - just for notes about each section)

The structure follows a clear client journey from problem identification through goals, measurement, value creation, services, and process.

Each section is organized to logically provide information.

### **Current Situation**

- **What it is**: Problem identification and baseline establishment
- **How it's different**: Focuses on the client's present state and pain points
- **What it isn't**: Not about solutions, deliverables, or future outcomes

### **Program Objectives**

- **What it is**: Desired business outcomes and strategic goals
- **How it's different**: Defines what success looks like from the client's perspective
- **What it isn't**: Not about services provided or how work will be done

### **Measuring Success**

- **What it is**: Quantifiable metrics and tracking framework
- **How it's different**: Focuses on data-driven accountability and progress measurement
- **What it isn't**: Not about goals themselves or the methods to achieve them

### **Value Creation**

- **What it is**: Business case and financial justification
- **How it's different**: Explains the ROI and strategic value of the investment
- **What it isn't**: Not about specific deliverables or measurement methods

### **What You Get**

- **What it is**: Service deliverables and access provided
- **How it's different**: Details the specific tools, resources, and support included
- **What it isn't**: Not about business outcomes or success metrics

### **What to Expect**

- **What it is**: Process description and engagement timeline
- **How it's different**: Outlines the methodology and workflow of the engagement
- **What it isn't**: Not about outcomes, deliverables, or business justification
