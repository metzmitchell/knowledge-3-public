# Proposal Writing Style

## Core Tone

This proposal uses a conversational yet professional tone that speaks directly to you ("you" and "I") with contractions and parenthetical asides (like "I'm on the phone a lot") to be approachable, while making it easy to digest with bullet points, bold emphasis, and progressive disclosure. The writing balances being personal and accessible while maintaining business credibility through specific metrics, clear expectations, and professional boundaries.

## Nuance Over Bluntness

A proposal is a sensitive document. The client is contemplating a significant investment and taking real risk. The tone should reflect that you understand the weight of their decision.

**Avoid:**
*   Being overly succinct or transactional
*   Matter-of-fact statements that feel cold or detached
*   Language that sounds like a sales pitch or infomercial
*   Overselling or guaranteeing outcomes

**Instead:**
*   Acknowledge complexity where it exists
*   Use language that shows you've genuinely thought about their situation
*   Be honest about what you don't yet know
*   Frame your value as a collaborative partnership, not a product

## Empathetic Authority

You are a trusted advisor, not a vendor. The goal is to communicate that you understand their world, you've seen similar challenges, and you know how to help. But without arrogance.

*   Lead with their situation and goals, not your services
*   Demonstrate understanding before offering solutions
*   Use phrases like "based on what you've shared" and "from our conversations"
*   Acknowledge that every situation is unique and requires exploration

## Honest Uncertainty

It's okay to say you don't have all the answers yet. In fact, saying so builds trust.

*   "I can't guarantee specific outcomes until we dig in and understand what's really happening."
*   "The exact methods and priorities will become clear as we explore together."
*   "What I can promise is that I'll own the problem and work through it with you."

This isn't hedging. It's honest. Clients respect it.

## Collaborative Framing

Position the engagement as a partnership:
*   "We'll work through this together"
*   "In collaboration with you"
*   "As we learn more, we'll adapt"

Avoid language that sounds like a one-way transaction where they pay and you deliver a fixed output.
