# Retainer Proposal Template
# Strategic Marketing Advising - Proposal Template

**Agreement between Rowan Marketing and [Client Name].**

**Prepared by Mitch Metz — [Date].**

## Current Situation

Here's where I will list out the client's situation and challenges.

The key is to get agreement on the problem we're solving and the context surrounding it.

Paint a picture of where they are today to allow you to demonstrate the progress you've made during and after your engagement.

## Program Objectives

This section is about getting clear on what the client wants you to help accomplish. Ask them what a home run looks like in working together. What future state will you help them create?

Here are some examples:

- Improve the volume, quality, and consistency of your leads.
- Build a company-wide and per-location marketing strategy.
- Become an "omnipresent" leader in the market(s) you serve.
- Make your business less vulnerable to competition through effective positioning.
- Create and maintain budgets that are aligned with your goals and financials.
- Track the results of your marketing channels and demonstrate an ROI.
- Streamline your marketing program with documented systems & processes.
- Improve the business valuation for future investment opportunities.
- Coach, guide, and mentor the marketing team to allow them to level up in their careers.
- Provide oversight and direction on the assets developed by our marketing team to ensure they meet quality and strategic objectives.

## Measuring Success

We'll measure success in working together in the following ways:

- Email newsletter subscriber growth
- More qualified leads and higher sales closing ratios
- A KPI dashboard that shows where leads are coming from to make better decisions
- New website is launched successfully
- Ads are able to generate inbound opportunities profitably
- Be in a position to attract investors and potential buyers with documented systems and a provable customer acquisition process.
- Average transaction value (relative to industry averages)

## Value Creation

The main goal is to increase business valuation which is achieved through top line revenue growth (not profit at this time). Every dollar of revenue generated in addition to current baseline creates a **5x multiple on value**.

Attracting more qualified leads and closing a higher percentage of deals will create additional revenue and therefore value for the company.

In addition to top-line revenue, potential acquirers are also looking for deep visibility into the key performance indicators and marketing processes—and will pay a premium for such assets in the case of a sale or investment.

Establish premium brand positioning in the market to maintain high prices and therefore profit.

## What You Get

You and one person get six months of private and unlimited 24/7 access to me via Slack, phone or email.

The program includes:

- Unlimited 1:1 access to me via Slack, email, and phone.
- A formal marketing strategy and systems that evolve over time.
- Weekly strategy calls with you and one person from your team.
- Structured assignments with due dates attached.
- Access to my personal network of vetted marketing specialists.
- Include me on key supplier calls and emails for added collaboration/feedback.
- A customized KPI dashboard to give you better visibility into your numbers.
- Access to the Mindshare Community for up to two people.

You can contact me any day or time with questions. I reply within 24 hours but usually more like 90 minutes during business hours.

## What to Expect

During the first month, I'll do a deep-dive discovery and analysis of your current marketing.

As information becomes clear, we'll develop a working marketing strategy document.

Equipped with the findings of our initial discovery process and strategy process, we'll create a 6-month roadmap, define your goals, determine KPIs, and allocate a budget.

For the following months, we will systematically build out each area of your marketing in order of priority. The faster we can implement, the more we can do.

During our engagement, you may send proposals, work drafts, supplier reports, marketing materials, and designs for me to review for feedback when required.

You will have direct access to my network of marketing specialists when needed to help build your team. To remain neutral, I don't mark up nor take a commission from anyone I refer.

You will receive a detailed marketing analytics report to help you understand your data and make better decisions with it.

You will be responsible for maintaining a KPI spreadsheet to maintain clarity on our numbers.

## The Fine Print

- You and one person from your team will have unlimited access to me.
- Additional stakeholders and/or outside suppliers may participate in our weekly calls.
- I will never publish any of your communications, publicly or privately. Anything you share with me will be kept in the strictest confidence.
- You are free to record any call for future reference without asking me first.
- You are welcome to call me any time without an appointment, but you'll probably get my voicemail (I'm on the phone a lot). Leave a message and I'll get back to you ASAP.
- If we need to talk in real-time, we can schedule a mutually convenient time.
- If you have a truly urgent question, you can text me on my personal cell number.
- Payment is due by the beginning of each month. Work will stop for late payments.
- You can pause the clock in the event of a family emergency or something of similar seriousness, but not for vacation or because you got busy.
- Twenty one (21) days notice is required for cancellation of month-to-month continuation agreements.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario. The parties consent to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario and the Superior Court of Justice - Ontario Courts having competent jurisdiction over Toronto, Ontario for any dispute arising out of a breach of any paragraph in this Agreement.

## Client Responsibilities

In order for me to deliver the best possible outcomes for your business, I require a commitment to transparency and open communication. Any material information you have should be shared in case it impacts the decisions and strategies we create.

Someone in your organization will be responsible for coordinating projects and asking questions of me as they arise. I will provide proactive guidance when I see opportunities to do so, however, you will be responsible for driving the implementation of the projects and making final decisions.

## Pricing and Terms

The Mindshare Program is a six-month program with ongoing monthly services available upon completion. The investment is a fee of **$5,500 per month** with a 6-month minimum term. Payment is due by the first day of each month. Monthly and quarterly renewal options will be made available at the end of 6 months, if desired.

## 100% Money-Back Guarantee

If we are not a good fit, I don't want your money. If you are not satisfied for any reason after the first 30 days, I will refund my entire fee in full. After that, there are no refunds or cancellations under any circumstances.
