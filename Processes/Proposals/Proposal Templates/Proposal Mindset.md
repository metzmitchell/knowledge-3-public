# Proposal Mindset & Methodology

> **"You are not here to pitch, trick, sell, or convince. You are here to help them solve a problem."**

This document outlines the core philosophy and tactical approach for writing, creating, and presenting proposals, synthesizing Kevin's methodology with the VIEW framework and Mitch's consulting model.

## 1. The Core Philosophy

### A Proposal is a Verification, Not a Pitch
A proposal should never contain new information. It is a **verification document** that confirms:
1.  You heard them correctly (Current Situation).
2.  You understand where they want to go (Goals).
3.  You know how to bridge the gap (Strategy).

If you are "hoping" they like the proposal, you haven't done enough discovery.

### The "Co-Buyer" Stance
You are not a vendor trying to extract money. You are a **peer** and a **co-buyer**.
*   **Advocate for them:** "If I were you, I wouldn't spend money on X until Y is fixed."
*   **De-risk the decision:** Frame your engagement as the safest path to their goal.
*   **Own the whole problem:** Even if you aren't *doing* everything, you are *responsible* for the outcome.

### The Internal State (VIEW)
Before writing or presenting, check your state against the **VIEW Framework**:
*   **Vulnerability:** Are you willing to admit if you aren't the right fit?
*   **Impartiality:** **CRITICAL.** Release attachment to the "Yes." If you *need* the deal, you lose your power as a trusted advisor.
*   **Empathy:** deeply understand their fear of wasting money or looking bad.
*   **Wonder:** Be curious about how to solve their puzzle, not just sell your package.

## 2. Writing the Proposal

### Language Strategy: "Mirroring"
*   **Use Their Words:** If they called it a "bottleneck," do not call it an "efficiency gap." If they said "revenue," don't say "sales."
*   **Specifics > Generalities:** "Increase leads by 20%" is better than "Improve marketing."
*   **The "Home Run":** Explicitly state what their ideal outcome looks like (captured during discovery).

### Structural Logic
The proposal follows the narrative arc of your sales conversation:
1.  **Current Situation:** "Here is where you are (pain, costs, risks)."
2.  **Objectives:** "Here is where you want to go (revenue, freedom, stability)."
3.  **The Gap:** "Here is what stands in the way."
4.  **The Solution:** "Here is how we bridge that gap."

### Packaging & Options
Never offer a single price. **Always offer 3 Options:**
1.  **Option 1 (The Anchor/Full Service):** "Done For You." The premium, white-glove, all-inclusive solution. This frames the value.
2.  **Option 2 (The Target/Hybrid):** "Done With You." The sweet spot. High value, shared responsibility, reasonable investment.
3.  **Option 3 (The Entry/Audit):** "Do It Yourself/Maintenance." A lower-risk step for hesitant clients (e.g., a paid audit or roadmap).

**Pricing Psychology:**
*   Price against the **cost of the problem** (e.g., "losing $10k/month in bad ads"), not your hours.
*   Price against **alternatives** (e.g., "hiring a full-time CMO costs $180k + benefits").

## 3. Presenting the Proposal

### The Golden Rule
**NEVER send a proposal without a booked call to review it.**
*   Sending a PDF into the void turns you into a commodity.
*   They will scroll to the price, make a snap judgment, and ghost you.

### The Presentation Flow
1.  **The Setup:** "I've put together some thoughts based on our last conversation. I want to walk through them to make sure I heard you correctly. If anything is off, we can change it right here."
2.  **The "Nod" Test:** Read the "Current Situation" and "Objectives" sections. If they aren't nodding, **STOP**. Ask, "Did I miss something?"
3.  **The Options:** Walk through the options from top (most expensive) to bottom.
4.  **The Ask:** "Based on what we discussed, Option 2 seems like the best fit for your timeline, but Option 1 gets you there faster. Which one feels right to you?"

### Handling "Let Me Think About It"
*   **The Co-Creation Response:** "Totally understand. Is it the price, or are you unsure about the strategy?"
*   **The Tweak:** "If we removed [Component X], would that bring Option 2 into a comfortable range for you?"
*   **Be willing to edit the proposal live.** This proves you are a partner solving a problem, not a salesperson protecting a commission.

## 4. Mitch's Specific Context (LTV Focus)
*   **Goal:** 2-year relationships, ~$48k LTV.
*   **Approach:** The initial proposal is just the entry point.
    *   **Start:** Strategy/Audit or Initial Build.
    *   **Transition:** Retainer/Advisory for long-term execution.
*   **Differentiation:** You are **AI-Native**. You don't just "do marketing"; you build systems that leverage the future of tech. Use this to justify premium positioning (efficiency, speed, future-proofing).
