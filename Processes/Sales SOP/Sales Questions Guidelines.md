# Sales Questions Guidelines
# Questions to Ask During First Two Sales Calls

High-level guidance for conducting the first two sales calls with prospects, specifically tailored for builder/construction clients but applicable broadly. Goal: gather information needed to write a compelling proposal while maintaining a consultative, co-buyer approach.

## Section 1: Pre-Call Mindset

From Kevin's Sales Thinking:

- **You're there to help, not to sell** - Find an ideal solution for everyone
- **Think like a co-buyer** - Advocate for your prospects
- **Look for the problem within the problem** - Don't accept surface-level requests
- **See yourself as a peer** - Not here to pitch, trick, sell, or convince
- **Be curious longer** - Ask questions and understand deeply before proposing solutions
- **Do not proceed until you have a clear grasp of how their business works** - even if it takes a long time

---

## Section 2: Call 1 - Validation (30 Minutes)

**Goal:** Determine mutual fit and identify disqualifiers.

### Understanding Their Business

**Questions (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- Tell me about your business - how does it work?
- How do you make money? (Unless they're in your niche, you need to understand this)
- What makes you unique or better than the competition?
- What category(ies) of products/services do they sell?
- Where do you make your money?

**Builder-Specific:**

- Project types (residential, commercial, renovations, new construction)
- Project values and typical margins
- Referral dependence vs. marketing-driven leads
- Capacity - how many projects can they handle?
- Team structure - who closes deals? Who manages projects?

### Current State vs. Goals

**Questions (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- Where are you today in relation to your goals?
- What's working and not working?
- Where are your bottlenecks?
- How bad is the problem? (Get them to quantify)

**What to capture:**

- Pain points in their own language
- Quantifiable problems (lost revenue, wasted time, missed opportunities)
- Current state to contrast with desired state in proposal

**Builder-Specific:**

- Lead quality vs. quantity - are they getting the right types of projects?
- Sales process - where do deals fall apart?
- Project pipeline - feast or famine cycles?

### Why Now? Why Not DIY?

**Questions (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- Why now? Couldn't you do this slowly or later?
- What have you tried already?
- Why not do this in-house/DIY?
- Who/what other options are you considering?
- Why me? I'm not the cheapest...
- If you could guess, what would be the biggest obstacle preventing us from succeeding?

**Builder-Specific:**

- Previous marketing attempts - what agencies have they worked with?
- Internal marketing capacity - do they have anyone handling this?
- Willingness to be transparent (Sheridan method readiness)

### Budget, Timeline, Decision Maker

**Questions (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- Do you have a budget in mind for this? Is it $10K, $100K, $1 million?
- $10M business, 3-5% on marketing = $42K/month
- Do some napkin math about total budget if needed
- Ensure the financial buyer is on the call

**Builder-Specific:**

- Calculate: How many projects do they need to close to pay your fees?
- Marketing spend as % of revenue (typically 3-5% for $10M+ businesses)
- Project margins to understand ROI math
- **Frame budget as total marketing investment (your fees + their marketing spend)**

### End of Call 1

**If there's mutual fit:**

- Suggest another call to explore scope in more detail
- Offer to bring some ideas to the next call
- One option might be a discovery project or up-front clarification engagement

---

## Section 3: Call 2 - Deep Discovery (60 Minutes)

**Goal:** Gather detailed information for your proposal.

### Current Situation (Deep Dive)

**Questions:**

- What have you tried already? (Get specific - what worked? What didn't?)
- What are the specific bottlenecks preventing you from achieving your goals?
- What's the cost of the current problem? (Time, money, opportunity cost)
- Probe deeper into their current situation
- Look for pain points and frustration in their own language

**What to capture:**

- Specific examples and stories (use in proposal)
- Quantifiable problems
- Root causes, not just symptoms
- Their exact language - use in proposal

**Builder-Specific:**

- Sales process - walk through a typical lead from inquiry to close
- Referral sources - how reliable are they?
- Website and online presence - what's working? What's not?
- Content creation capacity - do they document projects?
- Project types - which are most profitable? Which do they want more of?

### Program Objectives: What Does a Home Run Look Like?

**Questions (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- What does a home run look like? (Get specific and measurable)
- The goal is to uncover their ideal outcome
- Try to make their goals specific and measurable if possible - vague goals have no value
- Don't worry about the "tasks" they want done - that's up to you to decide later. Write them down anyway.

**What to capture:**

- Specific, measurable goals (not vague aspirations)
- Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes
- Their definition of success (not yours)
- Prioritized objectives

**Builder-Specific:**

- Lead volume and quality - how many qualified leads do they need?
- Close rate goals - what's realistic?
- Project type goals - do they want to shift to higher-margin work?
- Positioning goals - do they want to be known for something specific?

### Measuring Success

**Questions (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- How will you measure progress towards these goals?
- It's impossible to know if you're making progress without being able to point to signs of progress
- A goal without measurement is a recipe for chaos and dissatisfaction later on
- If they don't know, help them clarify their goals

**What to capture:**

- Specific KPIs they care about
- How they want to track progress
- Current baseline metrics (if available)

**Builder-Specific Metrics:**

- Number of qualified leads per month
- Lead-to-close conversion rate
- Average project value
- Project margins
- Customer acquisition cost
- Sales cycle length

### Marketing ROI Calculations

**Goal:** Determine if working together makes financial sense. Understand total marketing investment (your fees + their marketing spend) and calculate ROI.

#### Questions to Understand Marketing Budget

- What's your current marketing budget? (Monthly or annual)
- What percentage of revenue do you typically spend on marketing?
- What are you currently spending on? (Break it down: ads, website, content, etc.)
- What's your total marketing budget including my fees?

**Builder Benchmarks:**

- $5-7M businesses: $15K-35K/month (3-5% of revenue)
- $10M+ businesses: $25K-42K/month (3-5% of revenue)
- Your fees + their marketing spend = total marketing investment

#### Key Metrics to Gather

1. **Average Project Value** - What's your average project value? Range?
2. **Project Margins** - Gross margin? Net profit per project? (Typically 12-20% for builders)
3. **Current Lead Metrics** - Leads per month? Close rate? Cost per lead? Customer acquisition cost?
4. **Sales Capacity** - How many projects can you handle? Who closes deals? Sales cycle?

#### ROI Calculation Framework

**Step 1: Calculate Total Marketing Investment**
- Your monthly retainer: $X
- Their marketing spend: $Y
- **Total: $X + $Y = $Z**

**Step 2: Calculate Break-Even**
- Total monthly investment: $Z
- Average project value: $P
- Net profit per project: $N (project value × margin %)
- **Required projects/month to break even: $Z ÷ $N**

**Step 3: Calculate ROI Scenarios**

**Conservative:** If you help them close 1 additional project/month
- Additional profit: $N × 12 = $AP/year
- ROI: ($AP - ($Z × 12)) ÷ ($Z × 12) × 100

**Realistic:** If you help them close 2-3 additional projects/month OR improve close rate by 10-20%

**Example from David Ross call:**
- $5-7M business, 12% margin, $400K average project
- $48K net profit per project
- $5K/month marketing = need ~1.25 projects/year to break even
- If close 2-3 additional projects/year = positive ROI

#### Questions to Validate Financial Feasibility

- If we spent $Z/month total on marketing, how many additional projects would you need to close to make that worthwhile?
- What's your current close rate? If we improved it by X%, what would that mean?
- If we helped you get X more qualified leads per month, could you close them?
- What's the cost of NOT doing this?

**Red Flags:**

- Can't afford your fees + marketing spend
- Math doesn't work (need unrealistic # of projects)
- Not willing to invest in marketing (just want advice)
- Margins too low to justify investment

**Green Flags:**

- Math works (positive ROI within 6-12 months)
- Understand total marketing investment (your fees + their spend)
- Have budget allocated for marketing
- See value of investing in marketing

#### Questions About Current Marketing Efficiency

- Are you currently tracking ROI on your marketing spend?
- What's working? What's not working?
- If you're spending $X/month on marketing, what results are you getting?
- What's your cost per lead? Cost per closed deal?

**Builder-Specific:**

- Many builders don't track marketing ROI - this is a red flag
- Industry benchmark: typically $2K-5K per qualified lead for builders
- Calculate their current customer acquisition cost

**Note:** Your fees are an investment in ensuring their marketing spend is effective. If they're spending $30K/month on marketing, your $5K/month fee is insurance that the $30K isn't wasted (16% "insurance premium").

### Value Creation: The Math Behind the Fee

**Questions (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- What's the value of solving this problem? (Quantify it)
- What happens if you don't solve this? (Cost of inaction)
- What's a customer/client worth to you? (Lifetime value)
- If we improved [metric] by X%, what would that mean?

**Business Case Examples (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- Aim for 10x returns over 1-3 years
- Make a conservative financial business case
- "If all we did was help you close one additional $400K project per year, that's $48K in net profit - more than covering my fees"
- "You're spending $60K/year on marketing - what's the cost of wasting it or not measuring properly?"

### Builder-Specific Deep Dive

**Ideal Project Types:**

- What types of projects are most profitable?
- What types of projects do you want more of?
- What's your ideal customer profile?

**Transparency and Content Readiness:**

- Are you comfortable being on camera?
- Are you willing to share pricing information?
- Are you open to documenting your process?
- Are you willing to answer questions publicly that competitors avoid?

**Team and Process:**

- Who closes deals? What's their process?
- What's your sales process? Where does it break down?
- How do you onboard new customers?

### Repeat What You Heard (from Kevin's Sales Thinking)

Before ending Call 2, summarize:

- Current situation
- Measurable goals (and subjective ones)
- Why they matter (value)
- Size of the gap
- Major obstacle (as they see it)
- Budget range and timeline

### Explain How You Work (General Terms)

**Topics to Cover (from Kevin's Sales Thinking):**

- Typical number of calls
- Strategy, planning, budgeting
- Who manages things and has access to you
- How you communicate (email/Slack/Zoom)
- Typical engagement lengths
- What they can expect in the first month

**Don't Get Too Specific Yet** - Save detailed scope for the proposal.

- Not willing to invest time/resources
- Unrealistic expectations

**Green Flags:**

- Clear, specific goals
- Realistic budget aligned with goals
- Financial buyer is engaged
- Sense of urgency
- Willingness to invest time/resources
- Realistic expectations
- See you as a peer, not a vendor

## Final Notes

The goal of these calls is not to sell, but to understand. If you understand deeply, the proposal writes itself. If you don't understand, no amount of proposal writing will save the deal.

Take your time. Be curious. Ask questions. Listen deeply. Use their language. Quantify everything. Make a business case. Then write a proposal that shows you truly understand their situation and can help them achieve their goals.
