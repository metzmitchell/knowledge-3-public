# Service & Offer Descriptions

**Use for:** Sales pages, proposals, "work with me" documents, and service descriptions.

**Voice Context:** These frameworks apply the "Operator Mode" from the [Communication Style Guide](../../shared-context/communication-style.md).

## Core Principles

### 1. The "Offer Spine"
Default structure for describing any service:
1. **Why this exists**
2. **"Is this you?"** (3-8 concrete "you might be here if..." bullets)
3. **What tends to change** (Outcomes anchored in business fundamentals, e.g., "Over the next 6-12 months...")
4. **What we actually do** (Concrete deliverables, cadence, access, artifacts)
5. **Who it's for / not for** (Self-qualifying blocks)
6. **Logistics** (Pricing, terms, expectations)

### 2. Concrete Consulting
Never leave "consulting" as a fuzzy word. Spell it out:
- **Meeting cadence** (weekly, bi-weekly)
- **Access type** (email, Slack, Loom)
- **Core artifacts** (playbooks, dashboards, lists)
- **Phases** (Diagnosis -> Plan -> Build -> Refine)

### 3. Grown-up Outcomes & Money
- **Outcomes:** Anchor in business fundamentals (margin, stability) and realistic timeframes. Use phrases like "In most cases, clients end up with..."
- **Price:** State starting price and typical term early. Connect cost to likely upside briefly. Treat money like logistics, not drama.
- **Fine Print:** Include a "how I like to work" section that sets boundaries and reassures around risk (cancellations, emergencies).

### 4. Invitational CTAs
Service CTAs should feel like starting a careful conversation, not closing a deal.
- "If you'd like to explore whether this fits where you are, the first step is a short call."
- "We'll look at what's going on and whether this kind of support makes sense."

## Service Description Template (Operator Mode)

Copy/paste this structure when creating a new service page or proposal section.

### 1. The Context (Why this exists)
*Short paragraph on the specific problem space.*

### 2. Is this you? (Structured Empathy)
*List of 3-6 concrete symptoms/situations:*
*   "You have X but can't get Y..."
*   "You've tried Z and it failed..."

### 3. What if you could... (Realistic Outcomes)
*Grounded benefits anchored in business fundamentals.*

### 4. What you get (Concrete Consulting)
*   **Cadence:** [e.g. Weekly 60-min calls]
*   **Access:** [e.g. Unlimited Slack access]
*   **Artifacts:** [e.g. Quarterly Roadmap, Dashboard]

### 5. Pricing and Terms (Logistics)
*"This usually starts at $X/month with a Y-month commitment. This covers [core value]."*

### 6. Fine Print / How I Work
*Honest boundaries and risk reversal.*

### 7. CTA (Invitational)
*"If you'd like to explore this..."*
