# VIEW Framework
# Vulnerability, Impartiality, Empathy, and Wonder in Business Consulting and Sales

The VIEW framework is a communication and decision-making methodology developed by Joe Hudson, an executive coach and venture capitalist based in Silicon Valley who has trained over 1,000 people across major organizations including Apple, Alphabet, SpaceX, and HP. Over his 25 years of personal, spiritual, and business experience, Hudson distilled his approach into four core principles that form the acronym VIEW: **Vulnerability, Impartiality, Empathy, and Wonder**.

At its essence, VIEW functions as **a checklist for treating ourselves and others with unconditional love**. Rather than a rigid methodology with textbooks, slides, or tests, VIEW operates as a **bridge between analytical and intuitive minds**, treating both modes of thinking as equally valuable and necessary. The framework addresses a critical gap that most decision-making and communication tools overlook: the emotional and psychological state of the person making decisions or engaging in conversations.

## Core Philosophy

The VIEW framework is fundamentally a **state of mind** rather than a step-by-step process. Rather than arriving with predetermined solutions or the assumption that you know the answers, VIEW-based consulting and sales operates from a place of genuine curiosity and trust that clients are best equipped to solve their own challenges.

This approach creates what's described as an "alternate reality where the impossible becomes possible"—clients find themselves able to express things they never thought they could, and consultants are freed to speak hard truths that somehow enable clients to do the same.

## The Four Components

### Vulnerability

Vulnerability in the VIEW framework represents the willingness to be open, honest, and authentic in communication rather than defensive or protective. This component acknowledges that genuine connection requires dropping the masks we typically wear in professional settings.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Being willing to acknowledge what you don't know
- Admitting when you're uncertain
- Being present to the actual dynamics occurring in a conversation rather than rigidly adhering to a predetermined script or outcome
- Speaking your truth even when it's scary
- Acknowledging fears and limitations
- Allowing yourself to be seen as you truly are

**What Vulnerability Is NOT:**
- Weakness or oversharing inappropriately
- Inappropriate self-disclosure
- Appearing incompetent
- Lacking confidence

**In Business Consulting:**
Consultants practicing vulnerability acknowledge the limits of their expertise and remain open to learning from clients' lived experience. Rather than positioning themselves as the all-knowing expert who has all the answers, a vulnerable consultant asks genuine questions and acknowledges uncertainty about the client's unique situation. This creates psychological safety for clients to be honest about challenges rather than performing competence or hiding problems.

**Example in Consulting:**
"I'm not entirely sure if this approach will work for your specific context—I'd like to understand your situation better before we decide together. What I know from similar situations is [X], but your business has unique characteristics that might change things."

**In Sales Conversations:**
A salesperson embodying vulnerability might say, "I'm not entirely sure if this solution is right for you—I'd like to understand your situation better before we decide together." This honesty builds credibility far more effectively than aggressive pitching, as prospects recognize authentic uncertainty over manufactured confidence.

**Example in Sales:**
"Before I tell you about our services, I want to be honest: I'm not sure we're the right fit yet. I need to understand your situation better. Can you help me understand what's really driving your interest in solving this now?"

**Practical Techniques:**
- Acknowledge when you don't have an immediate answer
- Admit when you're uncertain about the best approach
- Share relevant limitations or constraints
- Be honest about what you can and cannot do
- Ask for help understanding their situation

### Impartiality

Impartiality means releasing attachment to a particular outcome or solution while maintaining commitment to the overall goal. This is one of the most counterintuitive aspects of VIEW because it seems to contradict normal business drive. However, Hudson's insight reveals that when we become rigid about *how* something must happen, we actually limit our ability to achieve the desired result effectively.

Hudson illustrates this through a river metaphor: when you move with the flow of a river toward your destination, there's minimal effort required. Conversely, when you insist on a particular path against the natural current, you expend enormous energy building canals and fighting resistance. Impartiality in business means being clear about your objective while remaining flexible about the mechanisms to achieve it.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Releasing attachment to specific outcomes
- Maintaining commitment to overall goals
- Being flexible about how objectives are achieved
- Not trying to achieve a particular outcome for yourself or others
- Noticing where you're attached to outcomes and consciously practicing letting go
- Creating space for genuine understanding rather than manipulation

**What Impartiality Is NOT:**
- Passivity or abandonment of objectives
- Not caring about results
- Giving up your goals
- Being wishy-washy or indecisive

**In Business Consulting:**
A consultant might say to a client, "Our goal is to improve your team's productivity. I have several approaches we could take, but I'm genuinely open to which method will work best for your specific context rather than attached to implementing my preferred solution." This stance allows the consultant to see what's actually needed rather than forcing a predetermined diagnosis.

**Example in Consulting:**
"I have a framework I typically use, but I'm not attached to it. If your team needs a different approach, I'm open to that. The goal is [X], not necessarily using my method. What do you think would work best for your culture?"

**In Client Relationships:**
Impartiality prevents the common consulting trap of over-selling services or pushing clients toward recommendations that serve the consultant's interests rather than the client's genuine needs. A practitioner of VIEW acknowledges when a competitor's solution might be better for a particular client, which paradoxically increases trust and often leads to more business.

**In Sales Conversations:**
Rather than operating from attachment to closing a deal or achieving a quota, sales professionals operating in VIEW practice impartiality by genuinely believing that the prospect is the best person to determine what they need. This eliminates the pressure-based dynamics that characterize traditional sales.

**Example in Sales:**
"I want to be clear: my goal isn't to convince you to work with me. My goal is to help you figure out what you actually need. If that's not us, I'll tell you. If it is, we'll both know it. Does that work for you?"

**Practical Techniques:**
- Notice when you're attached to a specific outcome
- Consciously release that attachment
- Focus on the goal, not the method
- Trust the process rather than forcing a predetermined path
- Acknowledge when another solution might be better
- Ask yourself: "Am I trying to achieve a particular outcome for myself?"

### Empathy

Empathy within the VIEW framework goes beyond simple emotional recognition to deeply understanding another person's perspective, constraints, and inner experience. In Hudson's methodology, empathy involves genuine curiosity about how the world looks from another person's vantage point, without trying to fix, judge, or change their perspective.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Being with a person in their emotional state without trying to change, fix, or escape it
- Remaining separate from their emotional experience—standing beside someone rather than losing yourself in their feelings
- Holding their hand without absorbing their story as your own truth
- Genuinely understanding another person's perspective, constraints, and inner experience
- Deep curiosity about how the world looks from another person's vantage point
- Not trying to fix, judge, or change their perspective

**What Empathy Is NOT:**
- Collapsing into the other person's emotional narrative (false empathy)
- Losing yourself in their feelings
- Trying to fix or solve their problems immediately
- Absorbing their story as your own truth
- Sympathy (feeling sorry for them)

**The Critical Distinction:**
True empathy involves remaining separate from their emotional experience—standing beside someone rather than losing yourself in their feelings. False empathy collapses into the other person's emotional narrative, while genuine empathy maintains both connection and boundaries.

**In Business Consulting:**
Rather than immediately diagnosing problems and prescribing solutions, an empathetic consultant first seeks to understand the lived experience of stakeholders affected by challenges. This might involve asking questions like "Help me understand what this situation feels like from your position" or "What constraints are you working within that I might not be aware of?" This creates deeper understanding than surface-level problem definition.

**Example in Consulting:**
"I can hear the frustration in your voice. Before we talk about solutions, help me understand what this situation feels like from your position. What constraints are you working within that I might not be aware of?"

**In Sales and Client Relationships:**
Empathy allows salespeople to recognize that prospects' hesitations or objections often stem from legitimate concerns rooted in their specific context. Rather than overcoming objections through persuasion tactics, an empathetic salesperson understands the fear, uncertainty, or previous negative experience driving the prospect's reluctance. This understanding often naturally dissolves resistance because the prospect feels genuinely heard.

**Example in Sales:**
"I sense some hesitation. That's totally understandable—you've probably had bad experiences with consultants before. Can you tell me about what's making you cautious? I want to understand, not convince you."

**Practical Techniques:**
- Ask questions to understand their perspective
- Reflect back what you're hearing
- Acknowledge their emotional state without trying to fix it
- Remain present with their experience
- Notice when you're trying to fix or change their perspective
- Maintain boundaries—understand without absorbing

### Wonder

Wonder represents approaching conversations and situations with genuine curiosity and openness rather than certainty. It's the quality of mind that asks authentic questions to learn rather than rhetorical questions designed to lead someone to a predetermined conclusion. Wonder is fundamentally incompatible with judgment; when you're truly wondering about something, you're not simultaneously judging it as wrong or right.

Hudson emphasizes that the technique underlying VIEW primarily involves asking **"how" and "what" questions** rather than "why," "yes/no," or leading questions. Why questions often carry an implicit judgment ("Why would you do that?" sounds like "You shouldn't have done that"). Closed questions that only allow yes/no responses signal that you're not actually in wonder—you're seeking validation for a predetermined answer.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Approaching conversations with genuine curiosity and openness
- Asking authentic questions to learn rather than rhetorical questions
- Incompatible with judgment
- Distinct from curiosity—wonder involves awe and genuine openness without searching for answers
- Seeing others as precious gems—the most intricate organisms in the known universe
- Not trying to change or influence them
- Basking in the joy of simple co-existence and the complexity of another human being

**What Wonder Is NOT:**
- Curiosity that searches for answers (wonder basks in the complexity without needing to solve it)
- Leading questions designed to persuade
- Questions that seek validation
- Certainty or knowing the answer
- Judgment disguised as questions

**The Distinction from Curiosity:**
Where curiosity asks "what's happening over there?" with the goal of finding information, wonder basks in the joy of simple co-existence and the complexity of another human being. Wonder means seeing others as precious gems—the most intricate organisms in the known universe—without trying to change or influence them.

**In Business Consulting:**
A consultant in wonder asks genuinely open questions: "How do you see this situation?" or "What would need to happen for this to work?" rather than "Don't you think the real problem is X?" or "Would you agree that we should do Y?" The open-ended questions signal authentic curiosity and invite clients to think more deeply rather than simply agreeing with the consultant's framing.

**Example in Consulting:**
"How do you see this situation?" (open, wondering)
vs.
"Don't you think the real problem is your team structure?" (leading, judgmental)

**In Sales Conversations:**
Instead of asking qualifying questions designed to move prospects toward a close, a salesperson practicing wonder asks genuine questions to understand the prospect's situation. "What's driving your interest in solving this now?" or "How have you approached similar challenges in the past?" open exploration rather than manipulating toward a predetermined sales process.

**Example in Sales:**
"What's driving your interest in solving this now?" (wondering, open)
vs.
"Would you agree that you need to solve this problem?" (leading, seeking validation)

**Practical Techniques:**
- Ask "how" and "what" questions
- Avoid "why" questions (they often carry judgment)
- Avoid yes/no questions (they seek validation, not understanding)
- Avoid leading questions
- Notice when you're trying to lead someone to a predetermined conclusion
- Practice genuine curiosity about their perspective
- See them as complex and worthy of understanding

## Application to Business Decision-Making

The VIEW framework addresses a critical vulnerability in even sophisticated analytical decision-making tools: **the emotional state and biases of the decision-maker**. Most analytical frameworks assume rational decision-making, yet they fail when the decision-maker's inner landscape is clouded by emotion, defensiveness, or attachment to particular outcomes.

**When to Apply VIEW in Decision-Making:**
The framework is particularly powerful when you notice yourself feeling triggered, defensive, or unusually certain about something. These are often signs that emotions are coloring your perception in ways that limit clear-seeing and wise decision-making. In business contexts, this might include decisions about hiring, strategic direction, client engagements, or organizational conflicts where emotional investment is high.

**The Process:**
The process involves using the VIEW state of mind to examine the decision with greater clarity. Rather than making the decision from a triggered or defended state, you first cultivate:
1. **Vulnerability** (acknowledging your investment and potential blind spots)
2. **Impartiality** (releasing attachment to your preferred outcome)
3. **Empathy** (understanding other stakeholders' perspectives and constraints)
4. **Wonder** (genuinely asking what you don't yet see about the situation)

From this clearer state, decisions tend to be both more ethical and more effective.

## Application to Business Consulting

In consulting contexts, the VIEW framework fundamentally shifts how practitioners approach client relationships and decision-making. Rather than arriving with predetermined solutions or the assumption that the consultant knows the answers, VIEW-based consulting operates from impartiality—genuinely trusting that clients are best equipped to solve their own challenges.

**Key Shifts:**
- From expert with all answers → to curious partner learning about their unique situation
- From prescribing solutions → to understanding their context first
- From attachment to closing deals → to genuine interest in their success
- From overcoming objections → to understanding legitimate concerns
- From leading questions → to open-ended wonder

**Client Relationship Transformation:**
Organizations that have trained teams in VIEW—including Apple, Alphabet, SpaceX, and HP—report that it becomes **one of the most powerful catalysts not only in business growth but in the fundamental quality of work relationships**. Teams discover that impartial goal-setting combined with empathetic implementation dramatically accelerates project timelines while improving team relationships.

**Product Development:**
Product teams using VIEW in their design process report that when they stay focused on the process (user research, iteration, learning) rather than becoming attached to a particular feature or design, the output consistently exceeds expectations. This aligns with design theory principles that trust in process leads to better outcomes than forcing predetermined solutions.

**Conflict Resolution:**
When teams operate from VIEW during conflicts, they move from positional bargaining (my solution versus yours) to collaborative problem-solving. By bringing impartiality (releasing attachment to being right), empathy (understanding why the other position makes sense from their perspective), and wonder (genuinely asking what needs aren't being met), teams often discover solutions that satisfy underlying needs better than either original position.

## Application to Sales

In sales contexts, VIEW fundamentally reframes the relationship between seller and buyer. Rather than operating from attachment to closing a deal or achieving a quota, sales professionals operating in VIEW practice impartiality by genuinely believing that the prospect is the best person to determine what they need. This eliminates the pressure-based dynamics that characterize traditional sales.

**Key Shifts:**
- From closing deals → to understanding needs
- From overcoming objections → to understanding concerns
- From qualifying prospects → to genuine curiosity
- From persuasion → to exploration
- From attachment to quota → to impartial service

**Sales Effectiveness:**
Salespeople trained in VIEW shift from transaction-focused techniques to genuine relationship building. Rather than overcoming objections through persuasion, they understand prospects' legitimate concerns through empathy and wonder. This creates more authentic conversations and, paradoxically, often leads to higher close rates because the relationship is built on genuine connection rather than manipulation.

**The Result:**
Communication that feels fundamentally different to prospects because it prioritizes understanding over persuasion, truth over closing techniques, and genuine connection over transaction.

## Practical Techniques for Cultivating VIEW

The beauty of Hudson's methodology is its simplicity. There are minimal techniques overlaid on the framework because **if you're truly in a vulnerable, impartial, empathetic, and wondering state of mind, the right actions naturally emerge**. However, Hudson does offer specific guidance:

### Primary Technique - Open-Ended Questions

The core technique involves asking **"how" and "what" questions** to maintain authentic curiosity. These questions are open-ended by nature and signal genuine wonder rather than attempts to manipulate or direct. When you catch yourself asking closed questions, seeking validation, or leading questions, you can recognize that you've left the VIEW state and need to recalibrate.

**Examples of Good Questions:**
- "How do you see this situation?"
- "What would need to happen for this to work?"
- "What's driving your interest in solving this now?"
- "How have you approached similar challenges in the past?"
- "What constraints are you working within?"

**Examples of Questions to Avoid:**
- "Don't you think the real problem is X?" (leading, judgmental)
- "Would you agree that we should do Y?" (seeking validation)
- "Why did you do that?" (carries implicit judgment)
- "Is this a problem for you?" (yes/no, closed)

### Meeting Technique

Hudson has developed specific techniques for running meetings from a VIEW perspective, though the fundamental principle remains cultivating the four-part state of mind.

### Deepening Self-Awareness

Rather than memorizing techniques, practitioners cultivate VIEW through understanding and ongoing practice of these principles, which deepens self-awareness and increases connection with the world around them.

### Self-Check Questions

When you notice conversations becoming defensive, productive conflict deteriorating, or decisions feeling off, you can recognize you've left the VIEW state and consciously return to it by asking:

- **Vulnerability:** Am I being honest about what I don't know? Am I acknowledging uncertainty?
- **Impartiality:** Am I attached to a specific outcome? Can I release that attachment?
- **Empathy:** Am I truly understanding their perspective, or am I trying to fix or change it?
- **Wonder:** Am I asking genuine questions to learn, or am I leading them to a predetermined conclusion?

## Common Misconceptions About VIEW

### Misconception 1: VIEW Means Giving Up Your Goals

Many business practitioners misunderstand impartiality as passivity or abandonment of objectives. In reality, impartiality in VIEW means you maintain crystal clarity about your goal while remaining flexible about how it's achieved. Hudson clarifies this through his process-oriented approach: if you focus on the goal as a rigid destination, you often fail; if you focus on the process with faith in it leading to the outcome, success is more likely.

### Misconception 2: VIEW Is Purely Emotional or Soft

Some analytical business leaders dismiss VIEW as emotional or lacking rigor. In reality, VIEW bridges analytical and intuitive intelligence. The framework actually enables clearer analytical thinking by removing the emotional distortions—defensiveness, certainty, judgment—that cloud most business analysis. When a team makes a decision from a VIEW state, they're integrating emotional intelligence with analytical rigor.

### Misconception 3: Vulnerability Means Oversharing or Weakness

Professional environments often equate vulnerability with inappropriate self-disclosure or appearing weak. Hudson's vulnerability is precisely calibrated—it means being honest about what you don't know, acknowledging uncertainty where it exists, and being present to reality rather than a false persona. This actually increases credibility and leadership presence.

### Misconception 4: You Must Be in VIEW State for Every Interaction

While ideal, the reality of business is that you won't always be perfectly embodying all four components. The framework functions as a **checklist for self-awareness**—when you notice conversations becoming defensive, productive conflict deteriorating, or decisions feeling off, you can recognize you've left the VIEW state and consciously return to it.

### Misconception 5: Empathy Means Absorbing Their Problems

False empathy collapses into the other person's emotional narrative. True empathy maintains both connection and boundaries—you understand their perspective without losing yourself in their feelings or taking on their problems as your own.

## Real-World Business Applications

### Client Relationship Transformation

Organizations that have trained teams in VIEW—including Apple, Alphabet, SpaceX, and HP—report that it becomes **one of the most powerful catalysts not only in business growth but in the fundamental quality of work relationships**. Teams discover that impartial goal-setting combined with empathetic implementation dramatically accelerates project timelines while improving team relationships.

### Organizational Culture

Hand in Hand Parenting and other organizations have embedded VIEW into their cultures, creating environments where productive conflict is possible because people trust that colleagues are coming from genuine curiosity and care rather than defensiveness or political positioning. This fundamentally changes the quality of decision-making and organizational effectiveness.

### Sales Effectiveness

Salespeople trained in VIEW shift from transaction-focused techniques to genuine relationship building. Rather than overcoming objections through persuasion, they understand prospects' legitimate concerns through empathy and wonder. This creates more authentic conversations and, paradoxically, often leads to higher close rates because the relationship is built on genuine connection rather than manipulation.

## Integration with Existing Sales Approach

The VIEW framework complements and enhances the consultative sales approach outlined in "Kevin Sales Thinking" and "Sales Questions Guidelines." Rather than replacing these methodologies, VIEW provides the underlying state of mind that makes them more effective.

**Alignment with Kevin's Sales Principles:**
- "You're there to help, not to sell" → **Impartiality**
- "Think like a co-buyer" → **Empathy**
- "Be curious longer" → **Wonder**
- "See yourself as a peer" → **Vulnerability**
- "Release all attachment to getting a 'yes'" → **Impartiality**

**Enhancement of Sales Questions:**
The VIEW framework transforms the questions from "Sales Questions Guidelines" from information-gathering tools into genuine exploration. When asked from a state of wonder rather than qualification, questions like "Tell me about your business" become invitations to understand rather than checkboxes to complete.

## When to Use VIEW

The VIEW framework proves particularly valuable when you notice yourself:

- Feeling triggered or defensive
- Unusually certain about something
- Trying to convince or persuade
- Attached to a specific outcome
- Asking leading questions
- Feeling pressure to close a deal
- Experiencing conflict or disagreement
- Making high-stakes decisions

**High-Stakes Situations:**
- Client conversations where trust is critical
- Sales calls where relationship matters more than transaction
- Strategic decisions with emotional investment
- Conflict resolution
- Team meetings where collaboration is essential
- Difficult conversations

## The Power of VIEW

The VIEW framework's power lies not in complexity but in its alignment with human psychology and the conditions that actually enable connection, clarity, and effective decision-making. By addressing the emotional and relational dimensions that most business frameworks ignore, VIEW provides organizations with tools to achieve both better outcomes and more meaningful work relationships.

When you operate from VIEW, you create an environment where:
- Clients feel safe to be honest about challenges
- Prospects feel understood rather than sold to
- Teams collaborate rather than compete
- Decisions are made with clarity rather than emotional reactivity
- Relationships deepen rather than remain transactional
