    # Writing Style for Projects:
    
    1. **Role and Purpose**: You craft project briefs for interior design enthusiasts to read. They are for projects by Design Consultants with Atelier Maison & Co. - a furniture and accessories store that offers design consultations. Written in the style of Studio McGee.

    - Avoids excessive use of adjectives
    
    - Writing at a 7th grade level
    
    - Emphasizes a balance of aesthetics and functionality.
    
    3. **Content Focus**:

    4. **Structure**:
    
    - Begins project briefs with the designer's name included in the first paragraph.
    
    - Uses some headings throughout the article

    # LS and ID Project Pages
    
    This project involves creating a new page using the Divi builder, editing Divi elements from a predesigned layout, optimizing images, and improving upon our existing template or creating new sections where needed.
    
    We have 3 different websites that we are adding featured homes to. Most of the steps are pretty much the same between all three companies, but I'll indicate where it differs. The 3 companies are Living Stone, ID.ology, and Atelier.
    
    [Here is an example](https://www.livingstoneconstruction.com/project/laurel-ledge-modern) of one of these pages.
    
    Download Images and Video
    
    A folder will be shared with you to download.
    
    ## Log into Wordpress

    ## Create the Page
    
    ID.ology & Living Stone: Create a new project
    
    Atelier: Create a new post
    
    Use the Divi builder, and load a template called "Project Page" or "Project Layout" That template will be loaded with everything you will need.
    
    - Alternatively, you can use the most up-to-date project page, loading from "Your Existing Pages"
        - If you use this, please update the project layout within divi library to the most update project page
        - 
            
            [](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd0j6fHZMJ_j0DppEd4nK-qM3wlJtPI_Xj7PNF1NNFVAXaPBlOajviDry30fiIWCDvcLwHt8iRdGbQoKfuksslA0oU2qoUHgsg6Ov3SXrtfbTlYFn_ZlybJG3rkvZSZnq485fH5YQ?key=vhXZ0P8K2Ae7MUZPUYjZzsOF)
            
    
    ## Video
    
    Under the video popup section at the bottom, upload the hd video to the website, add a title and alt text to the video, and use the main image as the cover for the video.
    
    Alternatively, I might share a youtube link.
    
    [](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfs63132i4O313HJoMusPxy8STg4wpazBpPDSs8OwuHesZ5mIoQX7h64G12CEgt4dqABQYGcUABjWjIcHaHY1hawXOcQH_u9Xa1Z2on1sEYHCSVvQhEdIXgw5pevep9fu485WS7hA?key=vhXZ0P8K2Ae7MUZPUYjZzsOF)
    
    Divi Video Module – use the video module or copy that into the template you work from.
    
    - Video module needs to be the actual Divi Video Module (not a code module with embed code)
    - Video modules section sizing is max height 1080px, max width 608px
    
    Sample: LS: [https://www.livingstoneconstruction.com/project/modern-cottage-hideaway](https://www.livingstoneconstruction.com/project/modern-cottage-hideaway)	ID: [https://idologyasheville.com/project/modern-cottage-hideaway](https://idologyasheville.com/project/modern-cottage-hideaway)
    
    ## Image Gallery
    
    Add all optimized images, ordered by name to the image gallery, with the main image first. Make sure they are ordered correctly in the image gallery. If you upload them in the correct order, they will automatically display in the right order. If you upload them in the wrong order, delete them from wordpress and try again. It's much easier than reordering the image gallery within wordpress.
    
    To put the images in the correct order, sort them first on your computer: Put your file viewer into a list view (not icon view) and sort them by name in descending order (highest number/last image at the top, first image at the bottom). If you import them into wordpress like that, they should show up in the correct order on the website.

    ## Main Image Slider
    
    Add the Slider Images to the main image slider in their numerical order.
    
    - Lazy load should be turned off
    - 5 number of carousel photos

    ## Add Text:
    
    In the folder will be a document with all the copy.
    
    There might be sections for each company (Living Stone, Atelier, ID.ology). They will be titled accordingly.
    
    Note: When you copy-paste, be sure to paste as html under the "Text" tab. Copy-pasting into "visual" tab includes a bunch of weird html formatting from the Dropbox document.
    
    Also be sure all the paragraph text has the <p> tag

    ## 3D tour popup
    
    You might also need to create a 3d tour popup. simply create a button with the link #3d-tour, and create a popup for that link. Please make sure these popups function correctly and look nice when they are displayed. There is one on [this page](https://www.livingstoneconstruction.com/project/laurel-ledge-modern) if you want to copy it.
    
    The iframe code will be provided separately or within the "Copy" document.

    For Living Stone, add to Custom Homes, Whole Home Renovation, or Commercial. This should be listed in the document.
    
    For ID.ology, add to "Portfolio"
    
    For Atelier, add to "Inspiring Spaces"
    
    - Prompt to generate tags:
        - Prompt 1: Research (company)
        - Prompt 2: Make tags for this project page (paste project page text)
