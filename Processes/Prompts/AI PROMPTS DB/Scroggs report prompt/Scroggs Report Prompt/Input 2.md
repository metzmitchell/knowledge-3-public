### Translating the numbers into the five priorities

| Priority (plan) | What the data says now | Strategic move | Quick metric to watch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Conversion-rate optimisation (CRO)** | • Contact page lands 120 sessions in May yet bounces 69 % (GA).<br>• Service pages bounce 66-75 %.<br>• CRM closes 62 of 237 lifetime leads (26 %) but top-of-funnel is only \~15 leads/month. | *Fix what is visible first.*<br>• Compress mobile page-load by 1 s; a 2 % lift in conversions is typical (Impact study). ([impact.com](https://impact.com/marketing-intelligence/mobile-seo-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))<br>• Add a cost-range PDF or “5-minute budget calculator” CTA to every high-bounce service page to target a 40 % bounce rate.<br>• Turn every site form into a GA4 event and tie it to the “Has Opportunity Been Contacted?” field in CRM. | • Form-submission CVR (goal: ≥3 %, the search-ad benchmark for construction). ([localiq.com](https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-search-advertising-benchmarks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| **2. Google Ads pilot** | • Traffic doubled in Apr-May without paid spend, proving search demand.<br>• Average CPC for home-improvement Google Ads in 2025 runs **\$1.63-\$5.26**. ([agencyanalytics.com](https://agencyanalytics.com/blog/google-ads-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [wordstream.com](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | • Capture 25 extra qualified leads/month (to hit the plan’s 40 QL).<br>At a 7.3 % search-ad CVR and \$5.26 CPC, budget **≈ \$1.8 k/mo** for 340 clicks. ([localiq.com](https://localiq.com/blog/home-services-search-advertising-benchmarks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [wordstream.com](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/google-ads-cost?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | • Cost-per-lead versus the CRM average revenue per sold job (**≈ \$120 k**). |
| **3. Blog & resource publishing** | • Two blog posts in top-10 entrances, but each under 1 min view time.<br>• Content creation claims only 10 % of average construction marketing budgets. ([webfx.com](https://www.webfx.com/industries/home-repair/construction/statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | • Shift from generic blogs to “Neighborhood guide” and “Storm-repair checklist” formats—top 2025 builder trends. ([newhomestar.com](https://www.newhomestar.com/blog/home-builder-marketing-agency?utm_source=chatgpt.com))<br>• Repurpose every post into short-form video; video is the highest-growth format for builders in 2025. ([dotmarketingsd.com](https://dotmarketingsd.com/marketing-trends-in-the-construction-industry-for-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) | • Organic sessions that land on new guides (goal: 500/month by Q4). |
| **4. News & press wins (Parks PR)** | • 0 media mentions logged; Source field blank on 67 % of rows. | • Pitch “Storm-season readiness” in July while restoration makes up 30 % of pipeline demand.<br>• Tag every press-driven lead as “Earned Media” in CRM to prove ROI. | • Earned-media leads per quarter (goal: 3 in Q3, 5 in Q4). |
| **5. Data hygiene (CRM + GA)** | • 5 of 15 key columns are >60 % blank (Source, Activity, Revenue).<br>• GA shows 0 conversions events. | **CRM** – make Source, Phone, Revenue Min mandatory; auto-populate Next Activity before saving.<br>**GA** – rebuild GA4 with: <br>  • Form-submit and phone-click events<br>  • UTM hidden fields that write directly into CRM Source<br>  • Monthly integrity audit run by Rowan | • “Unknown Source” rows (target <20 % by October).<br>• GA4 events firing rate (goal: 100 %). |

### How this supports the three strategic pillars

1. **Credibility & Trust**
Press placements + educational guides position Scroggs as the storm-recovery and fixed-budget authority. Blog/video cadence also feeds social proof.
2. **Predictable Demand Generation**
CRO plus paid-search math shows that a repeatable ad budget of about \$2 k can fill the 25-lead gap between current intake and the 6-month goal.
3. **Referral Flywheel**
Better tracking lets you prove ROI on partner and past-client referrals, then automate quarterly check-ins once Source data is clean.

### Two broader 2025 trends to lean on

- AI-guided content personalisation is now mainstream; 71 % of CMOs are investing eight-figure budgets in AI tools to optimise creative and media. ([businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/marketing-leaders-ai-strategies-cmo-insider-breakfast-cannes-lions-2025-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
**Action**: Let Rowan’s AI engine produce variant headlines and meta-descriptions for each service page based on GA engagement signals.
- Mobile-first indexing punishes slow pages, and even a one-second speed gain lifts conversions by 2 %. ([impact.com](https://impact.com/marketing-intelligence/mobile-seo-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
**Action**: bundle image compression and lazy-loading into the upcoming CRO sprint.
