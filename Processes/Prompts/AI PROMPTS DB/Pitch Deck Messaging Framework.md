# Pitch Deck Messaging Framework

Prompt: Help me write clear, persuasive messaging for my pitch deck. I need copy for these slides: 1) Problem, 2) Solution, 3) Market opportunity, 4) Why now, 5) Product overview, 6) Business model, 7) Traction, 8) Team, 9) Ask (funding or support). Each section should include strong one-liners, supporting bullet points, and persuasive framing — especially for pre-seed or early-stage positioning. Make the tone confident and clear, and avoid corporate jargon. Inputs: Startup name, what you do, problem you solve, ideal customer, market size, traction (if any), team background. Example Inputs: Product: Simple invoice app for freelancers. Problem: most tools are bloated or expensive. Market: 100M+ freelancers worldwide. Traction: 300 users in beta. Ask: $150k pre-seed. Tone: bold but honest.
