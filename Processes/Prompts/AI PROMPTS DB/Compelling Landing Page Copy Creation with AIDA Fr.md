# Compelling Landing Page Copy Creation with AIDA Framework

Prompt: Create compelling landing page copy that follows the AIDA framework: Attention (headline + subhead), Interest (relatable pain), Desire (benefits + proof), and Action (clear CTA). The tone should match a modern online business — engaging, benefit-focused, and story-led. Include a breakdown of the structure in your output so I can copy/paste sections into a page builder. Also suggest headline/testimonial variations I can A/B test. Inputs: Product name, what it does, target user, pain points, transformation, testimonials if any. Example Input: Notion workspace template for freelancers
