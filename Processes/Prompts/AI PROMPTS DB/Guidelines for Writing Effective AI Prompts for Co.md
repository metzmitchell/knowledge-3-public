# Guidelines for Writing Effective AI Prompts for Cold-Email Campaigns

Prompt: Please create a set of clear, practical guidelines for writing effective AI prompts. Follow these steps:
1. Research and Context
• Review the materials I will provide, including:
– A sample prompt and background information from a leading prompt-engineering company.
– Commentary from Y Combinator that explains key lessons from those materials.
• Perform any additional research you need to clarify best practices.
2. Focus and Use Case
• The main application is a cold-email campaign, though the guidelines should be versatile enough for other projects.
• Keep the advice concise, actionable, and easy for non-technical team members to follow.
3. Reference Materials
• The reference materials give you an idea of the prompts I will be creating using your prompt guidelines. You don’t need to rewrite any of these. They are only for context.
• I will send you a set of draft prompts for the cold-email sequence. These aren’t written well, but give you an idea of the category of output I want from your prompt guidelines.
• I will also provide an overview of the company that will be using these prompts.
4. Deliverable
• This should be in markdown and xml
• There can be different prompt guidelines  for different types of prompts (IE: researcher, copywriter, thinker)
