# Copywriting Knowledge Base - New Priority-Based Structure

## Overview
The copywriting knowledge base has been reorganized using a priority-based numbering system to improve discoverability and workflow efficiency. Files are now organized by importance and usage frequency rather than traditional categorization.

**⭐ SPECIAL INDEX:** `INDEX-YOUTUBE-PRIORITY.md` - Curated list of most valuable prompts for YouTube-first content workflow, ranked by utility for 5-10 minute YouTube scripts and multi-format content creation.

## Metadata System

Each file now includes standardized metadata headers:

```markdown
---
Priority: [1-4] ([Essential/High/Medium/Low - Reference])
Content Type: [Manual/Generated]
Last Updated: 2025-01-28
Usage: [Brief description of when to use this file]
---
```

## Priority Usage Guide

**Priority 1 (Essential):** Core voice documents used daily across all contexts
**Priority 2 (High):** Context/channel-specific guidelines used regularly
**Priority 3 (Medium):** Advanced guidelines and best practices referenced occasionally
**Priority 4 (Low - Reference):** Template prompts used for specific tasks as needed

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Improved Discoverability:** Priority numbering helps quickly identify most important files
2. **Workflow Efficiency:** Essential files are grouped together and easily accessible
3. **Clear Hierarchy:** Understanding of what to reference first, second, etc.
4. **Reduced Redundancy:** Files are organized to prevent overlapping content
5. **Better Maintenance:** Clear structure makes updating and maintaining content easier

## Usage Recommendations

- **Start with 00-CORE-VOICE/** for all copywriting tasks
- **Reference 01-VOICE-BY-CONTEXT/** when adapting voice for specific audiences
- **Use 02-CHANNEL-SPECIFIC/** when creating content for specific platforms
- **Consult 03-CONTENT-GUIDELINES/** for advanced techniques and best practices
- **Browse 90-GENERIC-PROMPTS/** when needing templates for specific copywriting tasks

## File Maintenance

When adding new content:
1. Determine appropriate priority level (1-4)
2. Place in corresponding numbered folder
3. Add metadata header with priority, type, date, and usage
4. Update this README if needed
5. Consider consolidating with existing content to avoid redundancy
