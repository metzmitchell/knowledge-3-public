# Onboarding
# Onboarding Clients

90 minute call

Most bi-weekly consulting calls are 90 minutes

## Kick Off Call Notes 1/25

Review contract

Don’t let the clients grab the reins and take over

Let the clients get onboarded with your way of working

- How you send the initial emails and first call

A lot of people sell services that don’t deliver. You are the opposite. Deliver early and quickly.

What happens later is a product of what you do today. Don’t skip over stuff or be reactive. Build the strong foundation to get organized and give the clients the jobs they need to be responsible for.

“We have to go slow in the beginning, it’s going to be mostly administrative for the first part of the call”

You’re driving the bus. If you’re not driving the bus from the very beginning, you’re not ever going to drive the bus. You want to lead the conversation.

Buyers remorse is a real thing, even if you think it’s a good purchase

### Objectives of kick-off call

Get your dashboard set up

Review the questionnaire - 40 min.

- Go over the goals and top priorities
- Put the top goals and priorities into the planning tab of the marketing dashboard
- Make sure you’re aligned
- Make sure they have correct goal expectations
    - Say these are the goals, is there anything else we’re missing?
    - Get clear. We’re always going to be working on these goals

Re-establish expectations

- How you work
- This agreement is advisory in nature
- You have unlimited access to me.
- You don’t have to worry about the clock when you’re talking to me
- Feel free to reach out to me via slack, email, phone, etc.

Establish internal stakeholders and their roles

- There’s a leader who you need to get buy in, who will get the company aligned on the goals
    - CEO usually, sign off, approve budgets
- There has to be a person who will implement
    - One defacto person who takes the ball and at least owns the project

Start developing a mini roadmap of known tactics/projects

- Pencil in some projects

Schedule the next few calls into the calendar.

- Explain how the next few weeks will work
    - I’m going to meet with these people
    - We’re going to get everyone on boarded with the way I work
    - In subsequent calls, we will layer in tactics and projects that we need to work on
    - Not dumping everything that’s possible to do at once

It’s about establishing good process so you can ramp up and scale your marketing and do it effectively without things turning to chaos

You want to become known for being organized, and not feel scatterbrained.

In client calls, you don’t need to create agendas, because you can review past call notes and look over the projects

You can group headings by department within the dashboard

### Kick off Email

- First thing your client sees after they’ve decided to do business with you
- Send this email even if they haven’t completely signed on and need to think of it

## Notes 12/2024

Write a questionaire for brands when onboarding

How you like to treat people, your values

Your strategy - what do you like to do to acquire clients? Word of mouth - who do you talk to? Other ideas you would enjoy.

How much you want to spend

How much you want to make every month

Website platform

CRM?

Email list?
