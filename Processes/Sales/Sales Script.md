# Sales Script
# Sales Script - Custom Home Builder Edition

*For Rowan Marketing's Builder Advisory Services*

## Core Value Proposition

**"I help builders sell custom homes more consistently than referrals, and with more transparency than an agency."**

## Key Principles

- You have no offer until you understand their specific marketing gap
- Builders know their craft - respect their expertise while bringing yours
- Look for the problem within the problem (often it's time, not knowledge)
- You de-risk their marketing investment - they own everything in-house
- Take the lead but speak as a peer who understands construction
- Ask questions, then be quiet - let them share their challenges
- Don't solve everything on this call - diagnose and present the path
- The goal is qualification and scheduling a deeper conversation

## Time Allocation (30 minutes total)

- Phase 1: 3-5 minutes (Agree to an agenda)
- Phase 2: 12-15 minutes (Discover the gap)
- Phase 3: 5-8 minutes (Clarity breakthrough & value exploration)
- Phase 4: 3-5 minutes (Commitment)
- Phase 5: 3-5 minutes (Next steps / schedule follow-up)
- Buffer: 2-3 minutes for conversation flow

## Pre-Call Preparation

- Do quick pre-qualification before scheduling
- Ensure the financial buyer is on the call
- Remove all distractions, quiet environment with no interruptions
- Review client information and answers
- Have something to take notes on/with
- Make sure you are recording the meeting (with permission)
- Lose all emotional baggage from the day and be calm and focused
- Practice state management anchor to get present
- If phone: use headphones so you can express yourself, be ready to dial on the minute

## Phase 1: Agree to an agenda

### Build Rapport

- Warm greeting and connection
- Ask about current projects or recent builds
- Connect over shared industry knowledge (NAHB, local builders association, trade partners)

### Set the Frame

- Take the lead while respecting their expertise
- Establish meeting structure
- "So we have about 30 minutes, I'd like to chat about your marketing goals and ways we could work together, and if it sounds like there's potential, we can schedule a follow up meeting to go into more detail."

## Phase 2: Discover the gap

### Understand Their Building Business

- "Tell me about your building company - what type of homes do you focus on?"
- Average home price and volume per year?
- What markets/communities do you build in?
- What makes you different from other custom builders in your market?
- Who are your typical clients? (retirees, move-up buyers, second homes?)
- Current backlog situation?

### Define Their Growth Goals

- "Where do you want your company to be in 2 years?"
- How many homes would you ideally build per year?
- Do you want to increase volume or average sale price?
- Are there specific communities or markets you want to break into?
- What does success look like beyond just more leads?

### Current Marketing Analysis

- "How are most of your leads coming in today?" (Usually 70-90% referrals)
- What marketing are you currently doing? (website, social, Houzz, etc.)
- Who handles marketing? (owner, office manager, outside agency?)
- "What's your biggest frustration with your current marketing?"
- How many qualified leads do you get per month?
- What's your close rate on qualified leads?

## Phase 3: Clarity breakthrough & value exploration

### Connect the Dots

- **Map the path**: "So you're getting most leads from referrals, but want more consistent, predictable flow..."
- **Break it down**: "This typically means building three things: trust assets (portfolio, testimonials), lead capture systems, and nurture processes"
- **Industry context**: "The builders I work with who've made this transition typically see results in 6-9 months"
- "Does this approach make sense for where you're trying to go?"

### Explore Why Marketing Help Now

- "What have you tried for marketing in the past?"
- "Why not just hire a marketing person internally?"
- "Are you talking to any agencies or other consultants?"
- "What made you want to explore marketing help now versus waiting?"
- "What's the main thing holding you back from the growth you want?"

### Budget Reality Check

- "Most builders your size invest $3-8K/month in marketing - does that align with your thinking?"
- "Are you looking at this as an expense or an investment in predictable growth?"
- Quick math: "If you close one additional $1M home per year, what's that worth?"

## Phase 4: Commitment

### Repeat What You Heard

- "Let me make sure I understand: You're building [X] homes per year, mostly from referrals..."
- "You want to get to [Y] homes with more predictable lead flow..."
- "Your biggest challenge is [time/expertise/consistency]..."
- "And this matters because [growth goals/succession planning/market position]..."
- "Do I have that right?"

### Self-Admission Check

- "What's stopping you from building this marketing system on your own?"
- Listen for: "Don't have time" / "Don't know where to start" / "Tried agencies before"
- If they say nothing's stopping them: "Sounds like you might not need help then?"

### Test Commitment

- "Are you serious about moving beyond referral-only marketing?"
- "Is building predictable lead flow a priority this year, or is it more of a nice-to-have?"
- "Based on what we've discussed, do you think I could help you build this?"

## Phase 5: Win-win offer & next steps

### Permission to Share How I Work

- "Based on what you've shared, I can definitely help you build more predictable marketing"
- "You're exactly the type of builder I work with - established, quality-focused, ready to grow beyond referrals"

### High-Level Approach (Builder-Specific)

- **My specialty**: "I help builders like you build in-house marketing capabilities - not complete agency dependence"
- **How it works**: "We'd start by reviewing your current marketing and finding quick wins, then build simple systems your team can run"
- **Structure**: "Most builders work with me as their marketing advisor - regular strategy calls plus hands-on help when needed"
- **Key difference**: "Unlike agencies, you own everything we build, and I teach your team to run it"

### Schedule Next Conversation

- "Let's schedule 45 minutes next week where I can show you exactly how this would work for your company"
- "I'll put together 2-3 options based on what you've told me about your goals and budget"
- "Should we include your [office manager/sales director] in that conversation?"

### Close Strong

- "Any immediate questions before we schedule?"
- "I'm excited about potentially helping you build this - you've got a great foundation to work from"
- "Let's get that next call scheduled while we're both here..."
