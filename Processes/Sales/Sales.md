if you can highlight the dream outcome, compare to the current situation, and sell the transformation between those two parts, then that's most of the battle. People buy outcomes, so you package something to help them get there.

### Sales process is important

- Don’t sell from scarcity
- You slow things down during the sales process
- Don’t chase prospects, don’t be desperate
- Make sure you know you’re solving the right problems
- Feel like you have mutual trust from the sales process
- This rolls over into the onboarding.

### Sales principles to remember:

1. You have no offer and don’t know what’s best until you know the gap.
2. Deliver accurate diagnosis.
3. Believe fully in your capacity to impact.
4. Take the alpha role. Nothing less.
5. Challenge objections hard when you can help.
6. Their problems are just that, THEIR PROBLEMS.
7. Don’t let them bullshit themselves (or you).
8. Be authoritative, raw, honest and real.
9. Ask questions, then silence. Make them work for it as this flips the power.
10. Give breakthrough, specific problem - but do not teach in a meeting - diagnose, present future and solution mechanics.
11. Release all attachment to getting a “yes”
12. People will do more to avoid pain than they will to gain pleasure.
13. People buy from people they know, like and trust buying from.

### Establish policies around payments

- I don’t work until after I’m paid
- Prefer automated payments

## Sales Questions

## Sales Mindset:

Remain open to the unfolding of the world around me

Don't be too hard on yourself

Clear defined offering. Figure out how those conversations should go

Ask more questions

Don’t reinvent the wheel for sales just because you don’t want to be uncomfortable

## Practical Checklist:

Always check internet speed when traveling

## Notes:

Practice the pitches of my business

Clarify at beginning of the meeting the desired outcome - is it a sales meeting?
