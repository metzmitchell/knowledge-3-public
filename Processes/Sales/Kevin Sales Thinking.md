## Intro from Kevin

## Mindsets

- You’re there to help, not to sell
- Your goal is to find an ideal solution for everyone – you and your prospects.
- Think like a co-buyer. Zig Ziegler quote: You want to be a co-buyer with your client.
- Advocate for your prospects.
- Look for the problem within the problem.
- You de-risk your clients’ business.
- You help companies achieve exciting outcomes.
- You’re not here to pitch, trick, sell, or convince.
- See yourself as a peer of your prospects.
- Your goal is to create mutual trust.
- When you specialize, your conversations will just feel different.

## Quick Overview

Kevin positions and sells advisory services by emphasizing the value of understanding the client's business, their specific needs, and the outcomes they are seeking. Here are detailed guidelines based on his approach:
Consultative Approach: Kevin advocates for a consultative sales approach, where the primary goal is to assess mutual fit. This involves deeply understanding the client's business challenges and goals, and positioning the advisory services as a means to achieve these outcomes.
Custom Conversations: Each sales call is treated as a custom conversation rather than a scripted pitch. This means actively listening to the client, asking insightful questions, and genuinely being curious about their business and the problems they are trying to solve.
Establishing Credibility: Credibility is established through authentic communication. Kevin suggests sharing relevant experiences, case studies, or insights that demonstrate an understanding of the client's industry or problem space. This helps build trust and positions him as a knowledgeable advisor.
Focus on Business Outcomes: Kevin emphasizes the importance of focusing on the business outcomes the client wants to achieve, rather than just the deliverables or the advisory process itself. This involves discussing what success looks like for the client and how the advisory services can help achieve those outcomes.
Balancing Implementation and Advisory: For those offering both implementation and advisory services, Kevin recommends keeping them separate to avoid confusion. This can be achieved through distinct websites/brands or by positioning implementation work as a productized service that complements the advisory offering. This helps maintain clarity and credibility.
Avoiding Rushing the Sales Process: Kevin stresses the importance of not rushing the sales process. This involves taking the time to understand the client's needs fully and ensuring that the advisory services are a good fit for what the client is seeking.
Tailoring Solutions: Kevin advises against offering one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, he suggests tailoring the advisory services to meet the specific needs and challenges of the client. This may involve customizing the approach based on the client's industry, the size of their business, or the particular challenges they are facing.
Demonstrating Value: Throughout the sales process, Kevin focuses on demonstrating the value of the advisory services. This can involve discussing past successes, how the advisory services have helped other clients achieve their goals, and the unique insights or methodologies that he brings to the table.
By following these guidelines, Kevin positions and sells advisory services in a way that is client

## Sales Process

- When a client reaches out, do a quick pre-qualification.
- Invite them to chat about their business on Zoom/phone call.
- Preparing for the call – Call Preparation.
- Ensure the financial buyer is on the call.
- Record the call to reference later (with their permission).
- Ask questions and aim to be curious longer.
- “Tell me a little about your business …”
- Understand how they make money (unless they’re in your niche).
- What makes them unique or better than the competition?
- What category(ies) of products/services do they sell?
- Where do they make their money?
- Show them you understand their business/industry.
- Do not proceed until you have a clear grasp of how their business works – even if it takes a long time.
- The counter-argument is this: process consulting.

### What are your goals?

- The goal is to uncover their ideal outcome.
- “What does a home run look like?”
- Don’t worry about the “tasks” they want done – that’s up to you to decide later on. Write them down anyway.
- Try to make their goals specific and measurable if possible – vague goals have no value.
- Examples of business outcomes/benefits - from the book, Selling to Big Companies, by Jill Konrath.

### How will you measure progress towards these goals?

- It’s impossible to know if you’re making progress without being able to point to signs of progress.
- A goal without measurement is a recipe for chaos and dissatisfaction later on.
- Look for things like:
    - Launch product by X date
    - Grow revenue by 20%
    - Increase profitability by 30%
    - Build a project management system
- If they don’t know, help them clarify their goals.

### Where are you today in relation to these goals?

- What’s working and not working?
- Where are their bottlenecks?
- How bad is the problem?
- Write it down, probe further, and put it in your proposals.
- Probe deeper into their current situation.
- Look for pain points and frustration in their own language.

### Explore the value

- What have you tried already?
- Why not do this in-house/DIY?
- Who/what other options are you considering?
- Why me? I’m not the cheapest …
- Why now? Couldn’t you do this slowly or later?
- If you could guess, what would be the biggest obstacle preventing us from succeeding?

### Ask for the budget

- $10m business, 3-5% on marketing, $42k/mo.
- You want to grow by $1M this year but you only want to invest $60k total – do you think that’s realistic?
- Do you have a budget in mind for this?
- Is it $10K, $100K, $1 million?
- Do some napkin math about total budget if needed.

### Repeat what you heard

- Current situation
- Measurable goals (and subjective ones)
- Why they matter (value)
- Size of the gap
- Major obstacle (as they see it)

### Explain how you work in general terms

- Typical number of calls
- Strategy, planning, budgeting
- Hiring and project scope co-development
- Typical engagement lengths
- Who manages things and has access to you
- How you communicate (email/Slack/Zoom)
- In-person or remote participation
- Possible options around training or mentoring

### Suggest another call to explore scope if there’s a fit

- If you both feel like there’s a potential fit, schedule a second call to explore possible scenarios.
- Feel free to test some scenarios and paint a picture of what’s possible.
- Offer to bring some ideas to the next call on how you could work together.
- One option might be a discovery project or up-front clarification engagement.

### Questions to consider

- “How do you adjust pricing as the engagement moves forward? I find that the first three or four months I deliver a huge amount of value but once that’s done, I move into a maintenance or support mode, so it seems to make sense to lower the price of my retainer.” – Mark
- “A client approaches you to fix something minor, like their website, but you know you can provide more value elsewhere. Which questions do you ask to help them get there? For example, you ask about their goals, but they want to start with a re-vamp of their landing page.” – Sam

## The Second Call

- On the second (or third) call, discuss general ways you could work together. See what resonates.
- Tell them you’ll put a few options together along those lines within the pre-discussed budget range and business case.
- In some cases, the client and you will know what you want and will basically decide to move forward on the call.
- Come to a general idea on budget and approximate ways you’ll approach your proposal – nothing should surprise them later.
- Schedule a proposal meeting on the call.

## Crafting Your Options

- Create a choice of “yeses”.

### Option Structure

- A lightweight option that gets the job done but may require more time/work on their behalf (e.g., deep-dive calls every other week and unlimited Slack access in between for one person).
- What they asked for in terms of budget and aligns with your sweet spot way of working (e.g., deep-dive calls every other week + unlimited email/30-minute calls in between for marketing team, access to digital courses, access to Rolodex, etc.).
- A premium option that gives them the most robust methods (e.g., twice weekly calls, training for manager, copy me on emails, access to digital courses, etc.).
- Avoid putting everything and the kitchen sink into your offers due to a lack of confidence.
- Ensure each price-point you offer is sufficiently different – otherwise people will be confused.

### Potential ingredients

- Who has access to you
- How people contact you (Slack, email, telephone, Zoom)
- Access to vetted network (freelancers, partners, investors)
- Access to additional resources (templates, training, methodology)
- Areas you’ll advise on or not (Sales, Marketing)
- Number of calls per month
- Unlimited access to you or not – and for whom
- Copy me on emails/join supplier
- Private or group training
- Deliverables or not
- Proactive vs. reactive advice
- Oversight or not
- Manage projects or not
- In-person or online
- Initial commitment period
- Payment terms
- Response times

## Common Structures

- Interim/Fractional CMO
- Advisory
- Coaching/Mentoring

## Presenting Your Proposal

- Share your proposal live on your Zoom during a call – never send it in advance.
- State your options + fees for each option and then don’t say anything.
- Gauge your client’s reaction. Ask them if they have a preference. Make a recommendation.
- If you get pushback on price or scope, ask them what they were hoping to see instead.
- If price seems to be the main factor, you have a few ways to respond …

### Overcoming price objections

- “In order to do this right ….”
- “If all we did was improve your business objective by x% it would mean covering my costs – not to mention long-term benefit.”
- “What would you like me to remove in order to accommodate your budget?”
- “I believe this low-price option is your best bet based on everything you’ve told me about your situation ….”
- If price is their only factor, it might be best to walk away. The most price-sensitive tend to be the least ideal clients to work with.

## Pricing

- Think (and speak) in terms of value.
- Work backward from budget and factor in their implementation costs in addition to yours.
- Your fees are an investment – not a fixed overhead. Your fees aren’t forever.
- Price anchor against their other expenses.
- Price anchor against the cost of an employee.
- Aim for 10x returns over a reasonable period (e.g., 1-3 years).
- You won’t always achieve a measurable positive ROI with every client. That’s okay.
- Make a conservative financial business case for your fees.

### Examples of a business case

- If all we did was sell one new account that would otherwise go unsold.
- You’re going to deploy $300k on marketing this year – what’s the cost of wasting it or not measuring properly?
- If we improved your website’s conversion by X it would mean …
- If we helped increase your leads by even 10% it would mean …
- If you increased your close rate by X% it would result in …
- You’re spending $500k+ to open this business — my fees are negligible in comparison and de-risk that investment.

## Guarantees

- Offer a guarantee if you can.
- Limit it to a trial period to make it less risky to try working with you.
- 100% Money-Back Guarantee – If we’re not a good fit, I don’t want your money. If you’re unsatisfied for any reason after the first 30 days, I’ll refund my entire fee in full.
- Sample of a Money-Back Guarantee

## A note on your website

- In the beginning, keep your services copy light and focus on typical outcomes and benefits you create.

## Questions

- How do you adjust pricing as the engagement moves forward? I find that the first three or four months I deliver a huge amount of value but once that’s done, I move into a maintenance or support mode, so it seems to make sense to lower the price of my retainer. – Mark
- A client approaches you to fix something minor, like their website, but you know you can provide more value elsewhere. Which questions do you ask to help them get there? For example, you ask about their goals, but they want to start with a re-vamp of their landing page. – Sam
- What’s a formula you use to establish what’s fair to price based on value?
- Besides getting inbound flow from creating a personal brand, what other strategies have worked for you to get great gigs? Have you tried cold DMs? Interested in how you’ve done it.
- The cost and “deliverables” tend to be an issue. I tend to get pushback on the cost and they don’t only want advice and guidance, they tend to want more tangible outputs. I always want to make sure I over-deliver, so feel the need to implement or do something extra to wow them.
- What are the top 5 mistakes you see advisory make and what would you do differently?
- How do you recommend others go about niching down? I know that’s the ultimate ideal, become a big fish in a small pond, BUT I get inbound from different industries and don’t want to close that door. So curious about your thoughts on how to go about it and when to do it.

## Quotes

“... it is not our job … to make standard everyday objects easier to sell by adding superfluous kitsch; rather it is our common task to make these objects in such a way that they serve people in the best, most lasting and beautiful manner possible. And it’s precisely this so-called ‘value-creating ornament’ that diverts us from this fine task.”

— Max Bill, Form, Function, Beauty = Gestalt

“We’re not designers, or programmers, or information architects, or copywriters, or customer experience consultants, or whatever else people want to call themselves these days… Bottom line: We’re risk managers. Designers who sell “design,” programmers who sell “code,” information architects who sell “diagrams” are selling the wrong thing. The thing to sell is reduced risk for the client. That’s what people want.”

— Jason Fried, 37signals (2003)
