# Earn The Deal Training / Script
# Earn The Deal (ETD) Sales Call Framework

## Preparation

To prepare for the conversation:

Remove all distractions from your environment.

Be in a quiet location with no interruptions or distractions.

Review client information answers.

Have something to take notes on/with.

Make sure that you are recording the meeting.

Lose all the emotional baggage from the day and be calm and focussed.

Practice your state management anchor to get present.

### If phone

Use headphones so you can express yourself

Be ready to dial on the minute.

## Sales principles to remember

- You have no offer and don’t know what’s best until you know the gap.
- Deliver accurate diagnosis.
- Believe fully in your capacity to impact.
- Take the alpha role. Nothing less.
- Challenge objections hard when you can help.
- Their problems are just that, THEIR PROBLEMS.
- Don’t let them bullshit themselves (or you).
- Be authoritative, raw honest and real.
- Ask questions, then silence. Make them work for it as this flips the power.
- Give breakthrough, specific problem - but do not teach in a meeting - diagnose, present future and solution mechanics.
- Release all attachment to getting a “yes”.
- People will do more to avoid pain than they will gain pleasure.
- People buy from people they know, like and trust buying from.

## Phase 1: Agree to an agenda

In phase one “Agree To An Agenda” we are going to build rapport for a couple minutes then invite the prospect to start the meeting. From there it's your responsibility to take the benevolent alpha role (kind and in charge) immediately by setting an agenda. You should practice delivering this section so it's smooth. Sales only happen when you have the alpha role and are leading the conversation. No-one will ever push back on your agenda but they might try and force their agenda on you after you set the agenda. You need to hold the line and resist talking about what you do or how much it costs. If the person pushes, then push back to your agenda which is you need to figure out if you’re the right fit and that you will not work with anyone that is not a good fit and maybe this isn't a fit. If they don't comply with your agenda (95+% will, but you will vividly remember the people that don’t…Trolls exist in real life too, not just on the internet.) Don’t let this bother you. Simply dodge the questions and restate the agenda before moving forward. Do not answer them. If you can’t take the lead, end the call. No sales conversation will ever close without you leading and holding the alpha role.

At the beginning of a sales meeting you come to that meeting knowing that you are there to elicit a decision from the person in the meeting. They come to the call thinking that they are there to “gather information” & get “options” on what is possible. It’s ok that they’re there to gather information as long as that information is being gathered for the purpose of making a decision. You’re ok with that. If the purpose of that conversation is for something other than making a decision then you guys are not so “ok” with that.

### Unacceptable prospect responses

“Tell me about what you do, what you offer, your service, your product for sale, how much?”

This is not to your benefit even though you think. “Oh boy this is an interested person”

The challenge is that they are not really understanding what it's “costing them to stay where they are.'' If they haven’t yet decided or understood what it's costing them to stay where they are then its not beneficial to talk about what you do and moving forward.

Our Reply: \[Restate The Agenda\]

Or…

“Well we offer lots of stuff, let’s find out what your challenge is to see if something we do applies. If nothing does, we will both know. If one does, we can explore that together to get you some help.”

Hey \[name\],

Hi, is that \[name\]?

Hey XXXX, \[your name\] here from \[your company\], (if doing call over the phone include: this call is being recorded for training purposes…)

Are you having a good day today?

What part of the country am I reaching you at right now?

What did you get up to over the weekend?

How’s the weather where you are?

Transition:

Option1:

Alrighty, well I have about an hour here today & we can dive right in and get started with this meeting if you’re prepared?

Option 2:

Alright \[name\], thank you for investing this time to investigate how you can serve more people.

You’ve booked an hour with me here today to learn about your business, so if you’re prepared we can dive right in?

Option3:

Alright, we’ll \[name\] thank you for investing this time to learn how you can improve your \[what your offer does\]. You’ve booked an hour with me here today, so if you’re prepared we can dive right in?

Option4:

Ok \[name\], I want to be respectful of your time as I know we booked an hour here today to discuss \[XYZ area of their life or business\]. So if you’re prepared we can dive right in?

In this part of the call you just want to get them comfortable & build a little rapport… Should only take a couple minutes.

### Setting the agenda

Option 1:

Ok, well how this call will go is I’m going to start off by asking you some questions about your \[what your offer does\].

Then if it sounds like I can help and if it sounds like we’re a good fit, I’ll explain what I have to offer, how that works and everything. And then at the end you can make a decision whether you want to be a part of it or not?

Then SILENCE. (Wait for the ok awesome then move forward)

Option 2:

Ok, we’ll the way this call will go is, I’m going to ask a bunch of questions; where you are in your business, where you want to be, what are the challenges or problems you’re facing.

And the way we work, we actually select the clients we work with, and the reason we do that is quite simply because we know who we can best help, and who we can’t. So after I’ve assessed exactly what your business needs to grow quickly.

One of two things will happen; first, if we can’t help or we’re not the best fit for you, I’ll let you know that and I’ll do my best to point you in the right direction to get the help you need, but if we can help and we are the best people to help, I’ll share what that looks like and you can decide you’re ready to step up, and we will make a decision on the call if we're going to move ahead and work together today. Does all of that sound good?

(Wait for the “yeah awesome” then move forward).

Option 3:

Ok, we’ll I am going to ask you some questions to find out if or how I can help you, then I’ll tell you what we have going on over here. You can ask me any questions that you would like, and at the end we can make a decision if we’re going to move ahead and work together.

Does that sound fair?

(Wait for the “sure does” then move forward).

## Phase 2: Discover the gap

In this section of the conversation you are gathering information to clearly define the gap between the current & desired situation to help you understand what is going on in the persons life/business and clearly define their vision for the future. Spend some time exploring it and clarifying it with them. Plain and simple, if somebody doesn’t know what they want and can't create an accurate picture of it with a datapoint and units of measurement attached to it they are unlikely to buy.

Do not attempt to solve any problems that are brought up here, just write it down to address later in the meeting. The person is not ready for products/services yet because you have not diagnosed the gap yet. Prescription without proper diagnosis is malpractice. The same is true for you. Don't prescribe anything yet. The goal is to get the picture of their situation and start to uncover goals. Once you have an accurate understanding of the gap between the current state and desired state & you understand the challenges keeping them there, move on to the next phase. Depending on the results your offer can deliver, you should write your own questions that are relevant to your market and area of expertise.

If they ask for the pricing or how it works before the right time…then tell them.

“I am not sure if I have anything to offer you yet because I don't have a clear picture of what your challenges are or how I could help solve them. What is the problem you are looking for help with?”

If they continue to pressure you for price or details on what you “do”?

“I am sorry you came into this conversation with the expectation that I’d just tell you all about myself and what I do. I help a number of people and I’m here to help you but without knowing about “your X” I cannot do that. So if you’d like to continue we can dig into what you need help with or we can end this call now”

If they are aiming too low help them aim higher. Widen what’s possible for them beyond what they can see for themselves. In this part you can use case studies or stories of people you have helped to help them see a bigger vision of what's possible.

\[Share Case Studies\]

I’ve worked with XXXX who is in the same industry and perhaps isn’t even as good as you are. And we implemented a system to do XXXX in which resulted in XXXX for him in just XXXX time. So I think by only aiming for your goal of XXXX you’re actually shooting yourself in the foot. We should aim for XXXX so if we come up short we are still leaps ahead of your goal. Does that make sense?

Ask the most precise & exact question as possible to define the gap for your prospect in his mind. Ask them the most direct question you could ask someone in your field that will get you the exact GAP they currently have.

So tell me… What were your exact profits last month and what would you like for them to be?

What is your ideal goal weight and what is your weight right now?

Exact Question Opening:

This opening is great for getting straight to the heart of why your prospects are in the conversation with you by defining where they are now and where they want to be in relationship to the results you help clients get.

(AVOID LOFTY QUESTIONS)

So how is your business going? What's going on in your business? How is your health? What’s going on with your health? How are you treating yourself from a health standpoint? What can happen here is a highly unhealthy person can reply and say: “We’ll I work out everyday and eat all organic foods.” which then puts you in a position where you think… “We’ll now I don’t think there is any opportunity to help this person here.” But what that mentor could say is “What is your ideal goal weight and what is your weight now?” What is the gap that exists right now so that we can look at that?

You must get a specific measurable figure before moving forward. This is essential to making the sale close and the prospect associating you and your service to their goal.

EXAMPLES:

So tell me,

Exactly how much money are you making in your business per month and how much do you want to be making?

What is your ideal goal weight and what is your weight right now?

Exactly how many new cars are you selling per month and how many do you want to be selling?

Vision Question Opening:

Vision questions are perfect for desire based offers where the prospect isn’t necessarily trying to solve a painful problem but are looking to experience a major dream and desire. So we ask a question that gets our prospects to begin sharing their vision and dream for the specific results you can help people with.

Examples:

So tell me,

So \[name\], tell me what is your vision for your \[XYZ\]?

Vacation

Wedding

Second home

Motivation Question Opening:

Motivation question openings are perfect for sales conversations where a prospect schedules a conversation with you and you have offers that can help people in a variety of different ways so your goal is to discover which one or reason why your prospect scheduled the meeting. Here we ask our prospect to share the motivation, specific challenge or goal they have that made them want to have a conversation with you.

Examples:

Ok \[NAME\], I’ll hand it over to you now,

Tell me, what motivated you to take the time out of your day and schedule a call with me to improve your \[XYZ\]?

Tell me what is going on in your \[XYZ\] that is so challenging, that you decided now was the time to reach out?

What is it that made you want to invest the time today to improve \[XYZ\] in your \[XYZ\]?

Why did you invest the time today to book this call, what specific challenges do you need help with?

If you get the gold awesome, If their response is ANYTHING other than that they have a problem or a massive desire they see you can help with here’s some probing questions:

Is there a challenge you’re facing in your \[XYZ\] right now?

Why do you think this problem exists?

How long have you been dealing with this?

Are there any other problems you’re facing?

Tell me more…

You’re looking for pain and problems, dig in where necessary.

The key to this question is listening to the response. If they are just there to gather information and find out what you do… you cannot proceed to the next phase.

You are not in the information giving business. You can respond with:

“Well, I don't know what I have to offer you, that is why I am on this call… to figure out if or how I can help you? Now what was it that led you to get on this call with me to discuss your XYZ?

### Current situation

Here we are discovering what is causing the gap in their life/business between where they are now and where they want to be. Think: “What is missing or going wrong for this person? What needs to happen for this prospect to reach their goals?”.

Ok, so let’s talk more about the challenges you’re facing right now…

Situation Questions:

What exactly are you selling? (must understand the business)

Ok, how are you currently pricing that?

Ok, and who is your ideal client?

Why do people buy from you? What’s the promise? Why you?

What are the results you’ve gotten for your clients? (Testimonials?)

Do you have an automated way to bring new prospects in every day?

What’s the sales process from ‘I don’t know you’ to ‘I’m paying you money’?

How many clients have you gotten this year?

How many sales have you gotten for \[XYZ\] this year?

GAP Questions:

Are you facing any challenges with \[XYZ\]?

What do you want to change about \[XYZ\]?

Implication Questions:

How is \[XYZ\] affecting your ability to \[grow or reach goals\]?

Are you happy with your business the way it is?

Tell me more about \[XYZ\]...

How does that make you feel?

Ratify and make them know you care.

Need Payoff Questions:

What would \[achieving XYZ result\] change your life?

Why does reaching your goal mean so much to you?

How would it impact your family if you achieved \[XYZ\]

In what other ways would \[solving XYZ problem\] benefit you/your business?

### Desired situation

Here we are discovering what their vision is for the future. Why do they want it? What will having XYZ do for their life? Here we want to clearly define what the prospect wants. All the tangible and intangible benefits of reaching their goal. So we want to be clear on what it looks like, feels like, the reasons getting there are important and how that will holistically impact the prospects life.

Let’s change gears for a minute and talk about why you want to achieve \[XYZ\].

Why is getting/solving \[XYZ\] important to you?

How long have you wanted to be there and not been able to achieve that?

What would things be different for your \[XYZ\] if you got to \[XYZ\]?

## Phase 3: Clarity breakthrough

Here we are going to connect the dots and identify the things necessary to achieve their desired outcome. The objective with the Clarity Breakthrough phase is to help the prospect visualize the necessary steps to go from their current situation to their desired situation. This doesn’t necessarily mean talking about your product or service, it's simply high level discussing the key components and how they work together to achieve the desired results.

Break down their goals into an easy to understand model, the relationships between all the components and how they lead to results. If possible make the outcomes measurable and figure out what they could expect to achieve.

So let’s figure out how to make this happen...

Where is your thought process at based on what we just broke down so I can understand where your mindset is at? Is that attractive to you?

I’ve always found that everything in life & business is connected. Would getting to XXXX have an impact on other areas of your life?

What would that give you the freedom to do, that you currently don’t have?

## Phase 4: Commitment

The commitment phase is where we now ask questions of our prospects to determine if they are serious about the results your offer can provide. The responses to these questions always bring in the emotional drivers. Things like being a single mother, recently going through a divorce, wanting to provide a better life for a child, someone reaching their fullest potential etc. There is always a POWERFUL reason behind why somebody wants to experience a transformation.

With the commitment phase, a powerful objection prevention strategy is to directly ask 5 questions relative to different commitment phases. Have the prospect confirm they are committed to the goal & desired situation you’ve defined, that they trust you, your offer and your company deliver great results, they trust themselves to implement it properly, that right now is the right time to focus on this and finally that you can hear it in their voice that they are being authentic.

Making an empowered committed decision is not a small thing. You must make me believe you’re in state & ready to improve your life.

### Self-admission opening

This opening to the Commitment Phase is fantastic for finding the reason why your prospect feels they cannot reach their goal without someone's help. This is their unique perception of why buying your product or service is worth it to them. This is also a Need-Payoff question.

Listen for:

I don't know how

I want to do it faster

I want a proven system

If they say nothing is stopping them then your response is the following:

“Understood, well, it sounds like you are in good shape then and you don't need any help achieving the goals of XXXX that you mentioned. So at this point, my recommendation is we don't waste each others time and move on.” Give them the opportunity to respond. They will respond in agreement or they will backtrack and get honest with you. If they get honest, then you can move to the next step.

Ok. So \[NAME\], tell me, what’s stopping you from achieving \[XYZ\] goal on your own?

(Right goal)

1. Are you 100% committed to achieving \[XYZ\] in your business? If not, why? If so, why? Do we need to make it larger? How do we make this goal worth sacrificing for?

### Trust us

1. Do you trust us? Based on what we’ve shared and what it takes to achieve \[XYZ\], do you believe this would work for you?

### Trust themselves

1. Do you trust yourself? This type of offer does require you to do some work here to achieve the results so are you willing and ready to do the work?

### Right now = right time

1. Is right now the right time for you to do this? Why or why not?

### In state

1. Can I hear it in your voice?

### Other great commitment questions

How much longer is it acceptable to you to be \[XYZ\] (living with this problem)?

What would it mean to you if we could get you \[XYZ\] and avoid \[XYZ\] (pain)?

## Phase 5: Win-win offer

### Permission to share offer

Option 1:

Ok XXXX, We’ll I can definitely help you with that.

I think you’re a good fit for what I do, would you like me to tell you about that?

Option 2:

From what I’ve heard today, there’s definitely work to do to reach that outcome, but we can definitely help you get there fast and I’m excited to offer you a spot in one of our programs that’s a perfect fit for where you’re at. Do you want me to tell you more about what we do?

Option 3:

XXXX, I have an idea. I’d love to help make this work for you. We have a service that helps to do this… Would you like me to tell you about what we do?

Play back the things that they’re looking for.

When you state what you are an expert at you want to say it in a way that speaks directly to what your prospect has just told you throughout the call and it should sound PERFECT for him/her. Script out how you present yourself and practice it until you can deliver it clearly and in a powerful way. You want your prospect to think “that’s me” and “That’s my situation right now” and “I definitely want to achieve that result”

Therefore… You must be the expert to help them here.

(STATE YOUR SPECIALIZATION)

Ok, so my expertise is helping \*\*\*\*\*\*\_ to \*\*\*\*\*\*\_ by \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.
Typically I work with \*\*\*\*\*\*\* and I help them \*\*\*\*\*\*\_.

Our most clients have been with us for \*\*\*\*\*\*\_ and are doing \*\*\*\*\*\*\_, but we start everyone off by using (Service/Product).

The next step when you do this correctly is that your prospect will say “Yes I want that result too” and ask you how they can work with you or what you have to offer. When they ask you need to present what you have in a clear way that does NOT SOLVE their issues.

Here you state what you do and how it works.

You MUST talk about it at a high level and keep it vague but not vague to the point where they don’t understand. Don’t talk about the features or anything like that because you will trigger the wrong “feature brain” in your prospect and you want to keep their brain fixated on the OUTCOME.

Your description of how your thing works should be no more than a couple minutes and it should be delivered clearly and with confidence. Do not talk about the price.

Then shut up.

Now your prospect will start asking questions about how it works. They will keep asking questions until they have a clear understanding of how it works and more importantly - how it will work for them.

When you present your offer in vague detail but still enough detail to be of interest the prospect then asks you for all the pieces they need to understand and they keep asking until the have the full picture that THEY NEED.

As you answer the questions be careful not to divert the conversation, just answer the specific question they asked you then shut up.

Eventually when your prospect has asked all the questions they have regarding the offer they will ask you the “price question”.

Option 1:

Awesome, so how the process works is the first month we….

Option 2:

Awesome, so here is the typical timeline for achieving XXXX. In the first month we…

Option 3:

Great! So here are my ideas for your XXXX and the timeline for looks like this…

\[Process + Offer + Delivery In Relationship To How You Get Results & Timeline\]

We’d expect you to get \[XYZ\] result within \[XYZ\] timeframe. Is that something you’d want to do?

\[Pause for 5 seconds\]

“\[Name\], I am happy to keep answering any questions that you have or if this is a fit for you and you would like to talk about how to put this into place for your business we can talk about that”.

### Urgency pricing

This method of pricing our offer is designed to reward prospects who make fast decisions. We can do this in a variety of ways. You can use discounts, bonuses, scarcity / exclusivity, risk reversals or any form of perceived value and tie that into this buying opportunity if they move forward right now. The underlying principle behind Urgency Pricing is that your best clients are the ones who know this is right for them and make decisions quick to reach their goals.

### Discount urgency pricing:

Option 1:

One-Time Sales

Well the everyday price for this and all the help that goes with it is \[$XYZ Investment\]. Now what I’ve found is that our clients that decide they want to get started right away… They tend to get the best results. And for no other reason than we like working with people that make decisions quickly we’ve got a fast-action offer that's available to you, \[short pause for clarity\] until the end of this \[call/meeting\] today. It’s \[$XYZ discount\] off. Making the investment \[$XYZ Investment\]. So if that's you.. Then the fast action offer is available...

Then silence.

Option 2:

Retainer Sales

“Well my fee for managing this for you is \[$XYZ Investment\] a month and there is a setup fee of \[$XYZ Investment\]. Now what I’ve found is that our clients that decide they want to get started right away… They tend to get the best results. And for no other reason than we like working with people that make decisions quickly we’ve got a fast-action offer that's available to you \[short pause for clarity\] until the end of this \[call/meeting\] today. We waive the \[$XYZ Investment\] setup fee and discount the monthly so it’s just \[$XYZ Investment\] per month for the first 3 months until you see the transformation. So if that’s you… then the fast action offer is available...

Then silence.

Or just waive the setup fee and not discount the monthly…you can experiment with what works best for you.

This SILENCE here is the most crucial part of your entire call. You MUST not cave in and you MUST remain silent until the prospect speaks. Sometimes this silence is longer than 1-2 mins.

You can call your reward for decisive action as a (scholarship, fast-action incentive, first meeting special)

### Scarcity / exclusivity urgency pricing:

Option 1:

Alrighty \[name\], we’ll as you know the way we work is we select the clients we work with and can only help new people per month. Right now we are sold out for this month and we have a seat that you can reserve starting the first of next month. The investment is $30,000. Now, if this is right for you, we can get the first payment taken care of and reserve that spot for you right now.

### #DealEarned, getting paid and onboarding clients:

We’re waiting for any words that mean let’s move forward with this:

“What’s the next step?”

“Ok well what’s next?”

“Ok how do we get started?”

“Ok let’s do it!”

When they are ready to move forward say:

Awesome! Well we can get you started right now if you want.

(OK well how do we do that… OK how do we do the payment… Words like this….)

We can do a credit card over the phone if you want.

(OK cool…. Or words to this effect)

So is that visa or mastercard, collect the details and BOOM!

### What we will not accept

Any words that do not mean yes or no. This decision is binary, not a grey area.

“OK well can you send me something via email?”

“OK well how do i get back in touch with you if I decide to move forward?”

“Ok I’m going to need to think about this”

“Ok I’m going to have to ask my business partner, wife etc.”

### Looping objections

This is where a prospect is at a point of decision but is doing what we call “the retreat to fine” by making up an objection and deciding not to move forward. That's where looping comes in where we use questions to loop back through different phases of the Earn The Deal conversation to help the prospect decide on what they want, get clarity on how to reach their goal or commit to advancing or completing the deal.

Looping is the most effective way to handle objections because its a process of empathetic listening, the readdresing the phase of Earn The Deal the prospect is lacking clarity or commitment on. If your prospect says no it could be because they are still uncertain on their desired situation, unclear on whether your offer will get them there, not truly committed to the goal, your offer or simply believe reaching the goal on their own or with another alternative would be more affordable & efficient than with your offer.

The only way for us to identify which area truly needs to be addressed is to ask questions, be empathetic, and loop back to the portion of the conversation necessary to reach the next level.

### Finance objections

Objection: I can’t afford it.

"Tell me more about that.” (Let them tell you.)

"Ok, so you shared with me throughout the meeting that this is exactly what you need to do to move forward. So tell me, how is it that you are going to afford to continue without it?" (“I can’t.”)

"So how can we make this a reality for you?”

Objection: I don’t have the money.

“Isn’t that why you came on the call to begin with!?”

Objection: I have no money.

Okay... \[Silence\]. We understand that finances can be a challenge, and we always do our best to work with people in this scenario. Let me ask you this, is this something you really want to do? Because if it’s not a good fit, that is okay, too.

(“Oh no, I want to do it.”)

Ok, so how can we make this happen for you?

Objection: Once I make some money then I want to work with you.

“So tell me how that would work?” (Let them tell you whatever.)

“Okay, so let me see if I’ve got this right? What you are saying is that you are going to continue to do what you have told me is building your business slowly, and isn’t even paying your bills. And you are going to continue to do what’s not working long enough to someday build up a surplus of cash to invest in what will work? Is that an accurate statement?”

(Well, that sounds silly, I know.)

“So how can we make this work for you?”

"So how can we make this a reality for you?"

### Time objections

Objection: How much time do I have to decide?

“How much time do you need to decide?”

“Is there something in particular you need to think about that we can discuss right now?” Flesh that out and talk about it.

Objection: I need time to find the money and look over my finances.

When will you be looking over your finances”,

“Awesome, I just friended you on Facebook, just reach out to me there and get enrolled by noon tomorrow and I will hold those savings for you until then.”

If they can decide in 24 hours, or the next day, we just set a specific TIME and DAY they need to enroll by to get the incentive price.

Objection: I just don’t make decisions on the spot.

“When will you be sitting down to think about it?”

If they can decide in 24 hours, or the next day, we just set a specific TIME and DAY they need to enroll by to get the incentive price.

Objection: I need some time to think it over.

“I get that... and I encourage that. We want this to be a great fit for everyone. Can I ask you this? What haven’t we discussed that you still need to think about? That’s why I take the time on these calls. I’m here right now to help you make an empowered decision. While you still have me on the phone here, what questions or concerns do you still have that are unanswered?” (Discuss those.)

If they can decide in 24 hours, or the next day, we just set a specific TIME and DAY they need to enroll by to get the incentive price.

Objection: Let me think about it and let you know.

\[Name\], I hear what you are saying, and most of our clients said the same thing. Here’s the thing: We know that we just met each other and we need to establish some trust before we do business together. So let me propose this: How about we connect with each other on Linkedin, and also, you can connect with the CEO too. If this doesn’t work, or you feel like we are not standing by what we are saying, you can tell all your friends not to do business with us and you can post a negative review. We are willing to put our reputation on the line here. All I’m asking for is one shot to prove this to you. What do you say? Does that work with you?

Objection: It’s not a good time.

“Do you mind if I ask you a question about that? When will it be a good time for you to start prioritizing the things you said are the most important in your life?”

Or...

“How will you know when it’s time to start doing and having the things in your life that you just told me where so important?

### I need to check with \*\*\*\*\*\*\_… objections

Objection: I need to check with partner / spouse / another person.

“Yes, I totally understand. That is very important. So let me clarify here. Are you saying you are in, and you just need to get a ‘sign-off’ from your \[spouse, partner, spiritual guide\], and then we are moving forward? Or is there something else?”

If yes, say, “Okay great. When specifically will you guys be able to talk?”

“Perfect. So you will have spoken with your spouse by noon eastern tomorrow...”

“Awesome, I just friended you on Facebook, just reach out to me there and get enrolled by noon tomorrow and I will hold those savings for you until then.”

If they can decide in 24 hours, or the next day, we just set a specific TIME and DAY they need to enroll by to get the incentive price.

Note: offer to get on the phone with the spouse and discuss, too. It works really well when you do. Just be sure when if they do come on the phone that you don’t start blabbing about you. Start the conversation by asking “Great, what questions do you have about us helping your husband/wife....(grow their business, lose weight, balance their hormones...etc)?” and address their concerns and questions only.

### Other objections

Objection: I’ve used services like this and still haven’t gotten the results I wanted.

“\[Name\], I hear what you are saying, and you’re not alone. There are a lot of people who have hired someone to get \[insert results\] and failed which I’m sure has lead you to a sour taste in your mouth about \[Your WWO\]. So let me ask you this… Do you believe that \[XYZ WWO\] does work for \[people/companies\] like yours when implemented properly?

Ok great… So you do believe in \[WWO\], then what do you believe went wrong the last time you tried \[XYZ WWO\]?

Ok… that makes complete sense. Thats exactly why we do this differently by doing \[how you do things differently\]...

Do you believe that if we were to work together to do \[XYZ WWO\] we could get it to work for you?

“Yes” - Great, are you ready to get started?

“No” - Ok \[name\], I can only imagine there’s somebody you don’t trust and it’s either me or you. Which do you think it is and let’s discuss that. What specific outcomes would you need to see to make this 100% worth the investment of time and resources? What would make this a complete no brainer for you? That’s exactly what we want to address for you so that you have the certainty you need to make an empowered decision about this in your \[life/business\].”

Objection: Do you have a guarantee?

“Absolutely. We guarantee that if you keep doing what you’re doing, you’ll get the same results. So that’s our guarantee. Now with that said, we also guarantee that our system works. But if you’re looking for an out before you begin, then we’re probably not a good fit for you because that’s really not the energy that will serve you or us. It’s all good either way. Let’s just be clear that you should either commit to this with the attitude that this is going to work for you fully and completely or you decide that it’s not right for you at this time. If it's not a good fit, that's totally ok. But I can assure you this, people who are looking for a reason for something not to work, usually find it.”

### The magic question…

Use this magic question if your prospect is on the fence:

“Look, the real decision you are making isn’t whether or not to work with me or anyone else out there. That’s really irrelevant.... The real decision you have to make is whether, or not, you are ready to commit to \[having the things they said they wanted to have in their business and/or life\], or whether, or not, you want to continue... \[having all the problems and challenges they just told you they had\]. That’s the real decision you are going to be faced with, until you are ready to change. So what do you say \[name\], are you ready to commit?

This is a magical. It makes the decision about gaining what they want in life, not about working with you.

Remember: They are not making a decision to work with you, mentor with you, or “buy your service”, they are making a decision on whether or not they want to stay stuck where they are, or move forward and gain the things in life they really want.

### First “No/Maybe/I need to think about it”

Not a problem. I hear what you are saying, and most of my customers said the same thing, but let me ask you a question:

Do you see that if we implement this properly, you would be able to get \[insert results\]?

Great… And if you got \[XYZ results\], would that be worth at least \[your investment\]?

Okay, so if you can see it’s worth

Okay, so if you can see that it’s worth \[your investment\], I guess the only reason why you would hesitate is that you are unsure if we can actually deliver, right?

Not a problem. Most people were in that boat.

That’s exactly why we lower the investment to begin working together. We’re looking for long term win-win clients and we’re certainly not getting rich here if we don’t help you get results right?

Again,

This is exactly why we offer \[XYZ risk reversal\].

I want you to know we’re in this for the long term win-win relationship with you. We’re obviously not getting rich if we don’t help you get results and that’s why we offer the fast action incentive!

So \[name\], what is it that is truly stopping you from making a decision on this… Is getting to \[XYZ result or goal\] truly the #1 priority for you in your life right now?
