Restructure and rewrite this into a message, why more leads will help you have a business that is stable for you, your family, your team, and their families. Write it like Alex Hormozi. It can be about half the length.

Introduce it by identifying their situation.

Include this key sentence somewhere:

If you want a thriving business that's stable for your family and your team’s families, you need to get picky about your clients. It’s not an ‘operations’ problem. It’s not a ‘hiring’ problem. Not even about your trades. It's a leads problem.m.

Let's talk about your current state and your desired state.

You are an experienced builder

Great pride in your craftsmanship.

You take great pride in the responsibility and trust that your team has given you to provide for them.

You love the custom homes that you build and the moments when you are working with a client who responds quickly and knows what they want and is ready to commit to what they want. And the final product is a work of true craftsmanship. You want to do more of that?

But each project requires a lot of attention and there are many pitfalls of building a beautiful custom home. Sometimes these projects can be delayed for months on end. And you are responsible for your team, your trades, and their families. So maybe you still have to diversify your services and offer renovations or  remodels.

But you don't want to be doing remodels. You want to be building beautiful, inspired, brilliant custom homes for respectful clients.

There are also things that pull you away from creating beautiful homes. You still have to deal with many aspects of the business that you don't like. Maybe you're still working on the books and chasing down billing. Or maybe you still have to talk to unqualified leads. The day-to-day management of trades and deliveries, acting as the project manager For multiple projects at once. All the extra time that you spend driving to job sites and micromanaging trades, chasing down payments - all of that time pulls you away from creating the business and life that you want for yourself, your family, and your team and their families.

you're stuck doing jobs you don't like just to provide for your team and family.

Imagine if you could be more picky about the projects that you accept.

The renovation projects that you had to take on - what if those were more perfect custom home clients?

Instead of an odd bathroom remodel, you can offer trades months of study work at a time between multiple job sites. Instead of spreading your superintendent thin, you can give him  Projects that are near to each other and He can pick from the best trades in town because they all want to work with you. Because you can offer them the most steady work.

Once you're working with the best people in town, you don't have to go to the job sites so often. Because you can afford to work with the top talent, you can trust them to create the quality that you have become so well-known for and are so proud of. You can also focus on your business. Once you overcome the mountain of admin tasks that have been piling up in your office, you can delegate. The admin and billing work. Maybe you can hire a controller.

If you know confidently that you will have consistent custom home builds throughout the year regardless of the seasonality, you can confidently hire great office staff.

Once you hire great office staff, and your job sites are working more easily and smoothly, You have more time. don’t have to babysit every project. Your time is leveraged. You can focus on the business more, but focusing on the business doesn't mean weekends or evenings. You can grow the business and be there for your family and community.

It’s a snowball effect of success. That means more time for your family, your community, and, ironically, building even better homes

If I’m a custom home builder with five employees, here’s what I’d likely want for my business:

### **More of the Right Projects**

- Consistent pipeline of high-quality, high-budget projects
- Clients who trust my expertise and don’t micromanage
- A steady backlog of work to keep my team busy year-round
- Larger, high-margin custom homes rather than smaller, lower-budget projects.
- They want clients who appreciate their craftsmanship and aren’t constantly second-guessing them.
- Many get frustrated with overly involved homeowners who micromanage every step.
- The ideal client respects their advice, makes decisions efficiently, and doesn’t try to cut corners.

### **Better Margins & Profitability**

- Less time wasted on unqualified leads
- Higher profit per project, with fewer surprises or costly mistakes
- More efficient operations so I can reduce unnecessary overhead

### **A Stronger Brand & Market Presence**

- A reputation that attracts clients who value craftsmanship and quality
- A website and marketing materials that reflect my level of work
- Positive word-of-mouth referrals and local recognition
- Reputation is everything. They want to be known as the builder to go to in their market.
- They’d rather get work through referrals than rely on paid marketing.
- Awards, features in local publications, and a strong Google presence help reinforce their credibility.

### **Less Stress & Fewer Fires to Put Out**

- A streamlined process for sales, marketing, and client communication
- Clearer expectations set upfront with clients
- Reliable subs and vendors who deliver on time and on budget
- Less time chasing payments, dealing with unexpected costs, or fixing subcontractor issues.
- More work life balance
- They don’t want to be the only one making decisions—having a trusted project manager, superintendent, or foreman takes a load off.

### **More Time to Work On (Not Just In) the Business**

- A marketing system that generates leads without me having to chase them
- A business that can run efficiently without requiring me to be involved in every little detail
- The ability to focus on growth, partnerships, and bigger opportunities
- Many builders are still involved in the day-to-day, wearing too many hats (sales, project management, etc.).
- They want to work on the business, not just in it—more time for strategy, growth, and their personal life.
- Many dream of a more structured, streamlined operation where they aren’t constantly putting out fires.

### **Talent & Labor Stability**

- Finding and keeping skilled workers is a major challenge.
- They want reliable, long-term relationships with quality tradespeople.
- Some want to train the next generation, but many are frustrated by the decline in young skilled workers.
- Builders know their employees and subs depend on them for consistent income.
- They want to keep their team busy year-round, avoiding slow seasons or layoffs.
- Many take pride in being able to provide jobs and support local trades.

Custom home builders tend to be a unique blend of craftsmen, entrepreneurs, and problem-solvers. Here are some common traits and backgrounds they often share:

### **1. Former Tradespeople Turned Business Owners**

Many started in hands-on roles—carpenters, framers, electricians, or general contractors—before moving into running their own business. They have deep construction knowledge and a strong focus on quality craftsmanship.

### **2. Detail-Oriented Problem Solvers**

Custom home building is full of unexpected challenges—weather delays, supply chain issues, client changes, etc. Successful builders are excellent at adapting and finding solutions without sacrificing quality or profit.

### **3. Relationship-Driven Leaders**

The best builders know that relationships make or break their business. They maintain strong connections with subcontractors, suppliers, architects, and clients, ensuring smooth projects and repeat referrals.

### **Cautious, not so Entrepreneurial**

Unlike speculative developers, custom builders don’t take on massive financial risk in land acquisition. They prefer controlled, client-funded projects but still have to navigate cash flow challenges and business growth decisions.

- **Construction is Risky & Cyclical**
    - Custom home builders operate in a highly volatile industry, where economic downturns, interest rate hikes, and material shortages can drastically slow business.
    - Many have experienced past recessions (2008 being a big one) and have seen companies grow too fast, only to collapse when the market shifts.
    - Instead of aggressive expansion, they prefer sustainable, controlled growth to ensure they can weather downturns.
- **Limited Interest in High-Growth Business Strategies**
- Unlike Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, they don’t chase VC funding, automation, or hyper-growth.

### **Proud Craftsmen**

Most builders take immense pride in their work and want their homes to be a reflection of their skill and expertise. They often lean heavily on reputation and word-of-mouth marketing.

**Quality Control & Reputation Matter More Than Scale**

- Custom home builders often work on high-end homes where craftsmanship and reputation are everything.
- Rapid growth can mean hiring untested subs, taking on more projects than they can manage, and ultimately hurting their reputation.
- They would rather be the best builder in their region than the biggest.

### **Hands-On, but Sometimes Overwhelmed**

Many custom builders still wear too many hats—estimating, project management, sales, and even on-site work. The smaller the company, the more responsibilities they juggle.

### **Independent and Hard to Market To**

They tend to be skeptical of traditional marketing and often prefer referrals and personal networking over digital strategies. Many only turn to marketing when they hit a slow patch.

Would you say these descriptions match the builders you work with?

### **Self-Reliance & Hard Work Ethic**

- Many custom home builders started from the trades, built their business from scratch, and value self-sufficiency.
- They tend to respect other hard-working professionals and expect people to "pull their own weight."
- Builders respect **self-made success** and expect the same work ethic from their team and subs.
- They are less likely to believe in government assistance programs or policies that they see as discouraging work.
- 

**They Prioritize Personal Control & Work-Life Balance**

- Many builders started their business to *be their own boss,* not to build a large corporation.
- A bigger company means more employees, more stress, and less hands-on work, which some builders don’t want.
- 

### **Traditional & Community-Focused**

- Many builders are deeply rooted in their local communities and rely on reputation and relationships.
- Family values, church, and local networking groups (like the Home Builders Association) are often a big part of their social circles.

Builders tend to be very community-driven, and their business relies on reputation, trust, and relationships. Their social circles often overlap with their professional ones, whether through church, networking groups, or local events. Many are involved in giving back, sponsoring little league teams, participating in the Home Builders Association, or supporting local charities.

It also explains why they can be a little skeptical of outside marketing efforts. Word-of-mouth, referrals, and reputation often carry more weight than digital ads or broad branding efforts. They trust what comes from their community more than what comes from the internet.

If you’re marketing to them, leaning into that local, relationship-based approach (rather than a hard sales pitch) tends to resonate better.

**Cash Flow is a Constant Challenge**

- Unlike product-based businesses, builders operate on tight margins and unpredictable payment cycles.

**For Their Employees**

- Job security is more important than rapid raises or aggressive hiring.
- They value a **tight-knit, reliable crew** rather than hiring a bunch of people they might have to lay off in a downturn.
- Employees who stick around long-term often get more responsibility and better pay, but they aren’t looking to “scale up” constantly.

**For Their Subcontractors**

- Builders tend to work with the same subs for years, valuing relationships over price.
- They want **subs who are dependable and will prioritize their jobs** over other work.
- They expect loyalty, quality, and professionalism—fly-by-night subs and unreliable trades won’t last long.

**For Their Families**

- A stable business means they can provide for their family without the stress of feast-or-famine cycles.
- Many builders value **family time** and don’t want a business that demands 80-hour weeks to stay afloat.
- They often see their business as something they can pass down to their kids or at least use to build generational wealth.

**Pro-Small Business, Anti-Overregulation**

- Since stability is the priority, they dislike policies that add financial or bureaucratic burdens (e.g., excessive permitting, OSHA mandates, new tax policies).
- They support business-friendly policies that help them run efficiently without government interference.
- Builders prioritize stability because they’ve seen the risks of overexpansion firsthand. They build businesses that can support their families, their teams, and their subcontractors reliably, rather than chasing big wins. This mindset translates into their sociopolitical views, where they favor local relationships, small business-friendly policies, and a **measured, practical approach** to change.

**Skepticism Toward Rapid Change & Big Promises**

- They’ve seen how fast things can fall apart, so they’re **naturally cautious** about sweeping political or economic shifts.

Like it or not, you are the one making it rain. You’re the one bridging the gab from paying clients to your electrician’s kid’s college fund.

### **More Predictable Revenue & Cash Flow**

- Building 5-7 homes per year provides a more **steady income stream**, reducing the risk of slow periods.
- More projects mean **less downtime between builds**, keeping subcontractors engaged and reducing overhead strain.
- Cash flow improves, making it easier to reinvest in equipment or key hires.

### **Stronger Relationships with Subcontractors & Suppliers**

- More projects mean **consistent work for your subs**, making them more likely to prioritize your jobs.
- You get **better pricing on materials** by buying in larger quantities or negotiating bulk deals.
- Long-term vendor relationships strengthen, leading to **faster turnaround times** and improved service.

### **Increased Profitability Without Massive Overhead**

- Many custom builders have high fixed costs (insurance, equipment, office expenses). More homes **spread these costs across more revenue**, boosting profit per project.
- If you already have a lean team, adding a couple of projects a year **increases revenue without adding a lot of overhead**.
- You can negotiate better contractor rates by providing **consistent work rather than sporadic jobs**.

### **More Stability for Your Team & Business**

- Employees and key subcontractors feel **more secure**, reducing turnover and training costs.
- A steady flow of work allows for **better workforce planning**, rather than scrambling to staff up when projects overlap.

I Target builders in markets that have a high single-project ceiling

- Instead of growing to 15-20 homes per year, some builders stay **at 8-12 but target ultra-high-end, multimillion-dollar projects.**
- This allows them to grow revenue and profitability without massively expanding operations.

You can do fewer renovation or remodeling projects

More Profit Without Losing Craftsmanship

- Unlike scaling to 12+ homes per year (which often sacrifices quality), 7 is a sweet spot—enough volume to be profitable, but not so much that you lose control.

Smoother Client Experience & Fewer Headaches

- Custom home clients demand a lot of attention. With more homes, you can afford A client liaison or selections coordinator to manage communication.

More Personal Freedom & Long-Term Business Value

- With a team in place, you step out of the daily fires and focus on:
- Building long-term relationships
- Developing better processes
- Positioning your business for higher-value projects

Risk Distribution: More projects can help spread out risk. A slight delay or cost overrun on one project can be offset by smoother performance on others.

### When Building 3 Homes per Year:

- Internal Team:
    - Typically a lean, multi-functional team where roles overlap.
    - Direct involvement of the owner or principal in day-to-day project oversight. sales, client communication, design consults, site management, and financial tracking.
    - Team members may handle multiple roles (e.g., project management, design oversight, client relations).
- Hands-On Management: You are intimately involved in all aspects—from the conceptual design phase through construction and finishing touches.
- Direct Supervision: Your oversight ensures each project meets your exacting standards; you’re often the primary decision-maker for design changes, subcontractor selection, and resolving issues.

### Transitioning to 6 Homes per Year:

- Expanded Internal Team:
    - Dedicated Project Managers: Hiring or promoting project managers to oversee individual projects becomes vital. This allows for multi-project coordination without diluting attention.
    - Specialization: More specialized roles in areas such as scheduling, cost control, design, and client management to ensure simultaneous projects proceed smoothly.
- Strategic Oversight: Your day-to-day involvement will shift from micro-managing individual projects to setting strategic direction, monitoring key performance indicators, and ensuring overall quality across projects.
- Relationship Building: More time becomes available—but and perhaps necessary—for cultivating relationships with high-end clients, expanding your network, and exploring new opportunities, rather than being bogged down in daily operations.
- Financially: You tap into increased revenues and improved margins.
- Managerially: Your role transforms from a direct project executor to a strategic leader who directs vision and empowers your team.
