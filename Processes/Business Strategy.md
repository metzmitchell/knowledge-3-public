# Business Strategy
## Rowan Builder Marketing

- I help builders sell custom homes more consistently than referrals, and with more transparency than an agency.

**Business Values**

- I believe in networking, experimenting, and building.
- I invest in technology. I am learning and using AI for current clients and to eventually explore future AI-native business ventures. I will bet that we will have AGI by 2030, and Agents capable of replacing 10% of white collar workers by 2027.

**Current Situation:**

- In the early stages of my advising company, my priority is to acquire clients with a high level of trust to refine my processes and provide great initial case studies and feedback.

## Business Goals

- Grow and maintain a good reputation
- Help Custom Home Builders
- Establish a long-term wealth building friendship

**Timeline:**

- 6 months
    - Get 3 clients of any type through referrals and networking.
- 1 year
    - Get 3 builder clients through industry referrals and networking.
    - Establishing myself as a trusted marketing strategist with deep industry knowledge.
    - Document my processes and SOPs for scalability.
    - Actively explore AI and automation, both for my business, but for my ultimate goal of building a more scalable AI-native business.
- 2 years
    - Have a stable income with time to explore AI-native business models with potential partners.
        - I don’t want a high-growth startup but also don’t want a small, mom-and-pop business.
        - Potentially a partner who can build a product but isn’t great at sales.
- 10 years+
    - Exit a business

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Persona name | Sean Gerber | Nicole | Alfred | Darrel |
| How many employees | 5 | 5 | 7 | 7 |

| What is their job and level of seniority? (if applicable) | Owner | Office manager who handles marketing, reports to owner | Director of sales | Director of sales |
| What does a day in their life look like? | 25% doing actual subcontracting, 25% managing project managers, the rest is running a business, with a little bit of marketing. Trouble delegating. | Answer phones and incoming leads, handle mail and keeping order in the office, assist owner and controller, make social media posts and work with marketing agency | Meet with trades, help manage construction side of some projects, visit lots with prospects, work with estimator, hand-hold clients through build process | Sales calls and networking, manage marketing and advertising, lot visits with prospects, close clients |
| What are their biggest challenges and pain points? Why are they buying what you sell? | Not enough time to understand or implement any marketing. Seeing other builders grow faster. | Owners want more leads | Want to be company president after owning an increase in sales | Wants real estate commission with a steady office job and supplemental income |
| What are their goals? What end result do you help them achieve? | Want stable inbound, want respect in the builder community. | A stable job | Partnership in the company | Higher volume of leads for more commission. |
| Where do they go for information? Podcasts, conferences, online communities, associations, memberships, etc. | Other builders at association events and conferences, business coaches & programs | Google search when the owner says it’s required | Podcasts, association events, looking at other builders. | Podcasts, social media, following other realtors. |
| What features are most important when looking for products or services like yours and why? | He wants ease and security. | She wants it to be what the owner wants | He wants growth. Whatever will have the most amount of growth over a couple years | Increase in the volume of leads |
| What would hold them back from buying what you offer? | Other firms offering cheap DFY that looks like a checklist | Not being able to get the owner on board | Requiring any administrative work that isn’t aligned with his perceived self value. | Not quick enough leads |
| What other key insights or information do we have about this buyer? | He has relied on word of mouth for over a decade, and sees competitors growing quickly, so he is sceptical of the required investment, and wants to just copy competitors for the lowest price possible. | She isn’t plugged into the industry, so is niche agnostic, unless the owner suggests something. As one of few employees, she has a surprising amount of buying power | He grew a construction company to live up to an identity, and left because managing a business required too much work. He strives for more balance, while wanting the identity of running a company | He took a pay reduction for stable income and regular business hours. He is still ready to deal with a lot of rejection and low quality leads. |
| Describe how they consume or use your products/services in context with the rest of their day/life? Tell a story about how their day works and where you fit in. | I help him delegate marketing ownership to someone on the team who is interested in doing it for 10 hours a week. He and I are CC’d on all marketing communication. He joins calls bi-weekly, and we review reports. He is especially active on a quarterly basis. He needs a lot of coaching when he keeps adding to the task list. | She corresponds with all required marketing people. We talk weekly, and she checks in every couple of days. I monitor proposals and communications. I coach her on required KPIs. She uses most of my supplier recommendations. | He uses the sales KPIs heavily, and frequently asks about leads. We call once per week, and getting him to do the work is difficult. | He is used to the hustle of being a real estate agent, so is nervous about a lower volume of leads. He actively researches marketing solutions. |
