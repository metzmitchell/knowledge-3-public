# Notes AIO=PR

## Outline

Intro

Why now?

Undervalued

Why this is happening?

Citing patterns, Google update

Who gets featured?

Sector matters

Construction isn’t going to be scientific research

Brand alignment

Search agent knows preferences - niche, aligned things more likely to be shared

Needs to allow bots to crawl

Is this AI Optimization?

Entity authority, forums, specific formatting, videos that are transcribed

## Notes

https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-m-working-on-a-presentation-DSg.rRTPSJK1qVS9oyPgYA#0

Good article on how to structure content: https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en/blog/post/october-2025/optimizing-your-content-for-inclusion-in-ai-search-answers

Super data-heavy article: https://arxiv.org/html/2507.05301v1

A comprehensive 2025 arXiv study of news source citations by leading AI models (OpenAI, Google, Perplexity) found that over 89–96% of all citations are to high-quality, reputable outlets, with a heavy concentration on mainstream, authoritative news sources. For example, OpenAI’s models cite Reuters and AP News for 35% of their news citations, while the top 20 sources make up 67% of all their citations.

“Our analysis reveals the following key findings. First, AI search models from the same provider exhibit similar citation patterns, while differences between providers are more pronounced. Second, all models demonstrate significant citation concentration, with a small number of news outlets accounting for a disproportionate share of citations. Third, we observe consistent left-leaning political bias across all AI search systems, despite their general preference for high-quality sources. Notably, however, user preferences for AI search responses show no significant association with either the political orientation or quality of cited news sources.”

## Notes

Sector makes a difference - peer reviewed journals for health, government docs, etc

Come up with suggestions for homebuilding, commercial construction, etc.

There’s a notable difference. SEO gave user a wide variety of authority levels (highly optimized niche semantic, next to high authority), AIO has a much higher concentration of reputable sources.

Authority importance trend was accelerated by Google’s recent update - only showing first page of results to bots. AI companies have crawlers, but none that rival Google.

AI gets past some paywalls. Important to ask when shopping PR - do you allow crawlers past your paywalls?

Personalized results - based on user’s previous activities. This increases the value of being cited by brand-aligned high-authority places

You aren’t going to replace SEO traffic with GEO. Referrals and direct traffic will take up some slack, but traffic will trend lower volume, higher intent.

## Bites

The less technical the game becomes, the more it is about merit

“Fewer links, higher stakes” (an article said that)

## Crawling

### Allow Crawling: Publication Types

- Metered paywall news sites
- Freemium model publishers (some articles free, some paid)
- Hybrid models with limited free reads
- Regional and mainstream newspapers prioritizing SEO

### Do Not Allow Crawling: Publication Types

- Hard paywall sites (e.g., Wall Street Journal, academic journals)
- Financial, trade, or highly specialized periodicals
- Publications using Cloudflare or bot-blocking services to lock out AI crawlers

### AI Search Engine Impact

- Inclusion in metered or freemium paywalled outlets helps AI search engines discover and summarize your work, increasing visibility.
- Strictly locked-down sites prevent effective AI indexing or referencing, limiting visibility unless your work is discussed elsewhere.

## Sidenotes

This isn’t the whole picture for AIO. Forums are also huge.
