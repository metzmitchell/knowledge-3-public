# Instagram Post - Adding Service Lines: Brand Architecture Decision

Adding a new service line? 🤔

Here's how to decide if it needs its own brand:

**1. Same buyer or different?**

Same person buying both? → One brand works.

Totally different buyers? → They need different brands.

**2. Can your team handle it?**

One brand = one website, one social strategy, one content calendar.

Two brands = double everything.

Be honest about what you can actually manage. 📊

**3. How are people finding you?**

People aren't browsing your whole site anymore. They're landing on one page, getting what they need, and bouncing (or converting).

Focused brands = clearer message = easier to find. ✨

I break down real examples from construction companies in this video.

Save this for later if you're planning to add a new division! 🔖
