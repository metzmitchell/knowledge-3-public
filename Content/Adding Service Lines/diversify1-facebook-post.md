# Facebook Post - Adding Service Lines: Brand Architecture Decision

Thinking about adding a new service line to your construction business?

Here's a simple way to figure out if it needs its own brand or if you can keep everything under one roof.

**Test 1: Are you selling to the same person?**

If your custom home clients also need renovation work, one brand makes sense. You're talking to the same buyer.

But if you're adding something totally different—like luxury custom homes vs. starter homes—those buyers need different messages. They probably need different brands too.

**Test 2: Can your team handle it?**

Running one brand is already a lot of work. Running two means double the websites, double the social media accounts, double the content creation.

Be real with yourself about what your marketing team can actually handle without burning out.

**Test 3: How are people finding you now?**

Here's the thing: people aren't browsing your whole website anymore. They're landing on one specific page from Google or social media, getting what they need, and either converting or bouncing.

Focused brands make it easier for both people and AI to understand exactly what you do. That clarity can be worth the extra work.

I walk through real examples from the construction industry in this video, plus a simple framework to help you decide.

What's your experience? Have you added a new service line recently? How did you handle the branding?
