1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:01,766
In the construction industry.

2
00:00:01,766 --> 00:00:02,700
Growth.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,100
Often requires diversification, which.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,866
Introduces. Operational complexity,
and this also.

5
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:08,333
Applies.

6
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:09,566
To your marketing,

7
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:12,333
your marketing operations,
and how people interact with your brand.

8
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:12,766
It's a big.

9
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:15,266
Decision to bring in another service line.

10
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:19,300
So I wanted to talk about how people often
do this with their brands.

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,500
Do they keep it in the same website
under the same brand?

12
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,333
Do they do different websites with.

13
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,866
The same social media, same branding?

14
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,700
Or is it all completely separate?

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,033
And I think that's a really

16
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,633
personal decision based on your business
and your business goals.

17
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,500
So here we have
what most people are probably.

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,100
Doing in the US. Right?

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,100
Like custom home and renovation.

20
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:42,566
Put it under the same thing.

21
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:44,333
Maybe commercial is on there too.

22
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,166
Maybe it's
just a footer link or something like that.

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,333
All of your services are on this.

24
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,833
It's all about building
trust with your brand.

25
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,500
All your testimonials kind of.

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,133
Build this.

27
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,766
Momentum for your brand.

28
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,400
It helps with the trust.

29
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,933
It's harder to talk directly.

30
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:06,066
To the consumer when you're on a.

31
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,433
Website
that's. Just talking about what. You do.

32
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,000
If I offered. Marketing services.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,666
Of all types to all people,
I would have to say, here's what I do.

34
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,900
Here are the things that I can do for you.

35
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,733
And I would have.

36
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:21,333
To put it. Up to the consumer
or the person on my.

37
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,833
Website to figure out.

38
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,700
How those things relate to their business.

39
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,433
But really, what I'm offering
is. Strategy.

40
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,833
Inside the construction industry.
So I can kind of.

41
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,866
Guess exactly.

42
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,066
The person
that's going to be on my website.

43
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,066
And I can say.

44
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,833
Here's how what I do applies to you.

45
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:41,000
So you end up talking about yourself
a lot more than the person

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,766
who's reading your website.

47
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,566
And it's. Difficult to talk directly.

48
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:45,700
To the consumer on your.

49
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,933
Website, but it still works like.

50
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:53,100
Here's a massive example of an extremely
successful national construction brand.

51
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,866
Kelly.

52
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:58,200
And they have tons of different services
on their one website.

53
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,466
So I mean, these are.

54
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:02,300
All a lot of like B2B services.

55
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,166
So maybe they have kind of one
general consumer.

56
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,600
That is.

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,166
Maybe shopping for multiple.

58
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,566
B2B services, or it's a.

59
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,633
Lot more about industry reputation

60
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:18,100
and trust for a brand than it is.

61
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,466
About. Speaking directly to a consumer.

62
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,066
So maybe that's coming into.

63
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,866
Play as to why they're.
All under one brand.

64
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:27,133
All of these things are extremely high
stakes.

65
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,833
they're all. Like, relationship
based purchases.

66
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,166
It's probably a long sales cycle.

67
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,166
So it makes sense that they have
all these things under one brand.

68
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,166
They're trying to build
a lot of reputation for this brand.

69
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,100
But this is a business
to consumer company.

70
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,766
They build.

71
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:41,533
New homes.

72
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:42,866
Ashton Woods and their.

73
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,766
Other Brand.

74
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,266
Is. Starlight Homes.

75
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,500
Ashton Woods. Is like.

76
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,866
Upper middle market homes.

77
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,200
So they're.

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
Immediately able.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,566
To talk to the people, people who love.

80
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:58,366
Design, love our homes.

81
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:02,100
So they're immediately
talking to the person reading

82
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,800
or visiting their website.

83
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,266
And I bet their social media and,

84
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:10,100
All of
that stuff is able to talk to their.

85
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,433
Consumer a lot more closely.

86
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,966
And their other brand,
Starlight Homes. Is.

87
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:17,166
The first time homebuyer, brand.

88
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,600
So their entry level homes,
first time home buying is a menu item,

89
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,566
making home ownership more affordable.

90
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,133
This is exactly the value.

91
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,033
Proposition
that they have. For this. Exact person.

92
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,000
It will be a lot harder to do this
if they. Were under one brand.

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,633
It would be way more likely.

94
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,166
That they're like, yeah, we do great.

95
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,100
Design, but.

96
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,966
We also do affordability.

97
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,366
And they're talking about we and us.

98
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:44,400
But this is a much
this is a pretty huge company.

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
This is probably a bigger.

100
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Company then range. Range line homes.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,366
Like look at all
these places that they serve.

102
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:54,233
So massive company I'm sure they. Have.

103
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,866
The internal operational. Capacity.

104
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,866
For their marketing team
to operate multiple brands.

105
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,100
Multiple, style.

106
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,933
Guidelines, multiple brand voice
guidelines, you know, different personas.

107
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:08,966
That their.

108
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,866
Marketing teams understand.

109
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,066
So here is.

110
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,633
A company that's not as massive.

111
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,766
As. Starlight Homes or Ashton Woods.

112
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,800
But they also have multiple brands.

113
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,466
Diller Jones is kind of in
my neck of the woods.

114
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,366
their. Main core offering.

115
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:30,166
Is, Custom homes,
When I visit this website.

116
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,633
I can kind of. See, here
are the the. Regions.

117
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:36,333
I mean, this is a very regionally
constrained business.

118
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:40,233
Their other companies are Douma
Architecture and Travis.

119
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,266
Travis interior design.

120
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,133
when I'm looking.

121
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,700
For a custom builder, like I get to see.

122
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,266
Custom homes and menu items about custom
homes When I'm looking for an architect.

123
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,266
I get to see. Things. About architecture.

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,866
And when I'm looking for interior design,

125
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,066
I get to see things about interior design.

126
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,633
There are a lot of obvious. Reasons why.

127
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,933
This works so well.

128
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,233
But on the other hand, they need.

129
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,266
To have separate.

130
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:07,133
Brands.

131
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:10,133
They need to. Pay for separate. SEO.

132
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:10,733
They need to.

133
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,566
Pay for separate, Instagram.

134
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,233
Video. Creation.

135
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,733
It adds on to the cost of their marketing.

136
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,600
And these brands need to. Build trust.

137
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,966
In the marketplace on their own.

138
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:25,966
So what is. Your team's marketing. Skills?

139
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,466
What are your growth goals?

140
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,966
Do you have. A brand that you want to.

141
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:32,433
Build all the trust. In.

142
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,700
Or do you want to diversify.

143
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,133
Your brand and speak.

144
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,966
Closer to the. Consumer?

145
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,633
Ultimately,
there are a ton of personalized.

146
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,200
Factors.

147
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,566
That come into play when you're making
this decision, and it's very nuanced.

148
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:46,033
And then to add on to all.

149
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:49,300
Of it, AI. Is changing how.

150
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,700
SEO works.

151
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,400
So this used to be
a little bit easier of a decision.

152
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,833
If you're if you only have the money
to put into one good SEO campaign,

153
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,466
drive as much traffic.

154
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,200
To your website as you can.

155
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,700
But now with. AI.

156
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,733
People are spending more time on.

157
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:08,266
AI. Platforms, and social media. Is.

158
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,400
Constantly getting more people to spend
time on their platforms and figuring out.

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,800
How to, Limit
the amount of outbound links.

160
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,900
So you're we're.

161
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,333
All getting less.

162
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,366
Traffic to our websites All of these.

163
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:25,533
Factors come into play.
So that people are.

164
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:29,433
Spending more time on specific platforms
and less time on your.

165
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,133
Website.

166
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,300
So they're coming to your website
in more fragmented ways.

167
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,500
They might come in through one exact page
and then go straight to the contact form.

168
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,033
Because they've learned about your
website, developed a relationship with.

169
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,100
You on Instagram, and don't really.

170
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,033
Care to, learn more.

171
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,866
About your brand on your website.
They've already done all that.

172
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,366
So that.

173
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,400
Could be an argument
for having separate brands, having.

174
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,933
Separate websites for exact services.

175
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,133
Because if AI.

176
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,800
Is looking, you know,
what's the company to.

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,300
Go to that does.

178
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,700
High end luxury
custom homes in one exact region?

179
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,066
Is it a company that.

180
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:05,566
Does.

181
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:08,866
Everything, or is it a company
that's talking about this.

182
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:11,233
Specific. Region on their. Entire website?

183
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,700
This specific service?

184
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,000
And then when people. Get there,
you're. Talking.

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,433
Directly to them.

186
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,000
So the technological.

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,666
Changes are another factor that comes
into play, making it kind of difficult.

188
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,466
To take older advice at face.

189
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:26,700
Value.

190
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,566
And that just adds
another layer of nuance.

191
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,100
To this. Decision.

192
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,833
I hope that.
This thinking. Process has helped.

193
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,200
You understand how to grow
and build a better business.

194
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,333
Thanks for watching to the end.
