*Key Takeaways*

- There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Your decision depends on your growth goals, marketing team capacity, and who you're actually selling to.
- Keeping everything under one brand helps build trust and works well for relationship-based purchases with long sales cycles. But it's harder to speak directly to specific buyers.
- Separate brands let you talk to niche audiences in their own language. The downside is higher marketing costs and each brand has to build trust independently.
- AI search and social platforms are changing how people find you. Service-specific sites might actually perform better when people are looking for something very specific.
- Start with your growth goals and marketing bandwidth, then pick the path that makes it easier for your ideal customers to find and trust you.
