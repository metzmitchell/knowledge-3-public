# LinkedIn Post - Adding Service Lines: Brand Architecture Decision

Adding a service line breaks your old brand strategy.
It forces a choice: one brand that does everything, or separate brands that speak clearly.
In construction, I see two models work:
Branded house: One site, one name, all your services. Trust compounds, but the message gets broad.
House of brands: Separate sites and names for each buyer segment. Clearer message, more cost and complexity.
Nationals can afford multiple style guides, social feeds, and SEO campaigns.
Regional builders usually can’t copy that playbook 1:1.
In this video, I walk through real examples and a simple way to choose your lane.
How are you structuring your next service line?
