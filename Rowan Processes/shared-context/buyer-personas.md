# Detailed Buyer Personas for Home Builders and Remodelers

## Executive Summary

This document outlines four primary buyer personas representing key decision-makers and influencers within homebuilding and remodeling companies. These personas guide service delivery, sales approach, and content strategy for Mitch Metz Marketing's consulting services. Each persona represents a distinct role, set of motivations, and engagement pattern that requires tailored positioning and communication.

### Market Context
The ideal client company has a marketing person on their team, or someone where marketing is part of their job. Clients need a budget to invest in their marketing of around $10,000 per month at least. These companies serve clients who value craftsmanship, reputation, and personalized service. The homebuilding and remodeling market operates on long sales cycles with complex decision-making processes involving multiple stakeholders.

**Note:** These four personas focus primarily on custom home builder contexts. Additional remodeler-specific personas will be developed as strategies expand for that demographic.
