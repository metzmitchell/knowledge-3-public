## Mindsets [00:02:30]

Fundamental mindsets for approaching sales conversations:

- **You're there to help, not to sell** - Your goal is to find an ideal solution for everyone – you and your prospects
- **Think like a co-buyer** - Zig Ziglar quote: "You want to be a co-buyer with your client"
- **Advocate for your prospects** - Look out for their best interests
- **Look for the problem within the problem** - Don't accept surface-level requests
- **You de-risk your clients' business** - Frame your value in terms of risk reduction
- **You help companies achieve exciting outcomes** - Focus on transformation, not tasks
- **You're not here to pitch, trick, sell, or convince** - Remove all manipulation from the process
- **See yourself as a peer of your prospects** - Equal footing, not vendor/buyer dynamic
- **Your goal is to create mutual trust** - Trust is the foundation of good engagements
- **When you specialize, your conversations will just feel different** - Deep expertise changes the conversation

## Sales Process [00:14:22]

### Pre-Qualification & Call Setup

When a client reaches out:

- Do a quick pre-qualification
- Invite them to chat about their business on Zoom/phone call
- **Ensure the financial buyer is on the call** - Critical for moving forward
- Record the call to reference later (with their permission)

### Call Preparation

Before the call, prepare to:

- Ask questions and aim to be curious longer
- Understand their business deeply before proposing solutions
- Show them you understand their business/industry

### Understanding Their Business

**Key questions to ask:**

- "Tell me a little about your business…"
- **Understand how they make money** (unless they're in your niche - then you should already know)
- What makes them unique or better than the competition?
- What category(ies) of products/services do they sell?
- Where do they make their money?

**Critical principle:** Do not proceed until you have a clear grasp of how their business works – even if it takes a long time.

The counter-argument is this: process consulting (generic approaches that don't require deep understanding).

### What Are Your Goals? [00:23:09]

**The goal is to uncover their ideal outcome:**

- "What does a home run look like?"
- Don't worry about the "tasks" they want done – that's up to you to decide later on. Write them down anyway
- Try to make their goals specific and measurable if possible – vague goals have no value
- Examples of business outcomes/benefits - from the book, *Selling to Big Companies*, by Jill Konrath

### How Will You Measure Progress Towards These Goals? [00:25:22]

**Why measurement matters:**

- It's impossible to know if you're making progress without being able to point to signs of progress
- A goal without measurement is a recipe for chaos and dissatisfaction later on

**Look for things like:**

- Launch product by X date
- Grow revenue by 20%
- Increase profitability by 30%
- Build a project management system

If they don't know, help them clarify their goals.

### Where Are You Today in Relation to These Goals? [00:27:57]

**Questions to explore current state:**

- What's working and not working?
- Where are their bottlenecks?
- How bad is the problem?

**What to do:**

- Write it down, probe further, and put it in your proposals
- Probe deeper into their current situation
- Look for pain points and frustration in their own language

### Explore the Value [00:29:10]

**Questions to understand their situation and alternatives:**

- What have you tried already?
- Why not do this in-house/DIY?
- Who/what other options are you considering?
- Why me? I'm not the cheapest …
- Why now? Couldn't you do this slowly or later?
- If you could guess, what would be the biggest obstacle preventing us from succeeding?

### Ask for the Budget [00:31:46]

**Budget context and questions:**

- Example: $10m business, 3-5% on marketing = $42k/mo
- Reality check: "You want to grow by $1M this year but you only want to invest $60k total – do you think that's realistic?"
- Direct question: "Do you have a budget in mind for this?"
- Range check: "Is it $10K, $100K, $1 million?"
- Do some napkin math about total budget if needed

### Repeat What You Heard [00:34:56]

**Summarize to confirm understanding:**

- Current situation
- Measurable goals (and subjective ones)
- Why they matter (value)
- Size of the gap
- Major obstacle (as they see it)

### Explain How You Work in General Terms [00:37:58]

**Set expectations about the engagement:**

- Typical number of calls
- Strategy, planning, budgeting
- Hiring and project scope co-development
- Typical engagement lengths
- Who manages things and has access to you
- How you communicate (email/Slack/Zoom)
- In-person or remote participation
- Possible options around training or mentoring

### Suggest Another Call to Explore Scope If There's a Fit [00:39:33]

**If you both feel like there's a potential fit:**

- Schedule a second call to explore possible scenarios
- Feel free to test some scenarios and paint a picture of what's possible
- Offer to bring some ideas to the next call on how you could work together
- One option might be a discovery project or up-front clarification engagement

### Q&A from First Call Section

**Question from Mark [00:40:54]:** "How do you adjust pricing as the engagement moves forward? I find that the first three or four months I deliver a huge amount of value but once that's done, I move into a maintenance or support mode, so it seems to make sense to lower the price of my retainer."

**Question from Sam [00:44:35]:** "A client approaches you to fix something minor, like their website, but you know you can provide more value elsewhere. Which questions do you ask to help them get there? For example, you ask about their goals, but they want to start with a re-vamp of their landing page."

---

## The Second Call [00:51:08]

**Purpose:** Discuss general ways you could work together and see what resonates.

**What to do:**

- On the second (or third) call, discuss general ways you could work together. See what resonates
- Tell them you'll put a few options together along those lines within the pre-discussed budget range and business case
- In some cases, the client and you will know what you want and will basically decide to move forward on the call
- Come to a general idea on budget and approximate ways you'll approach your proposal – nothing should surprise them later
- Schedule a proposal meeting on the call

---

## Crafting Your Options [00:53:05]

### Create a Choice of "Yeses"

**Option Structure - Three tiers:**

1. **A lightweight option** that gets the job done but may require more time/work on their behalf
   - Example: Deep-dive calls every other week and unlimited Slack access in between for one person

2. **What they asked for** in terms of budget and aligns with your sweet spot way of working
   - Example: Deep-dive calls every other week + unlimited email/30-minute calls in between for marketing team, access to digital courses, access to Rolodex, etc.

3. **A premium option** that gives them the most robust methods
   - Example: Twice weekly calls, training for manager, copy me on emails, access to digital courses, etc.

**Important principles:**

- Avoid putting everything and the kitchen sink into your offers due to a lack of confidence
- Ensure each price-point you offer is sufficiently different – otherwise people will be confused

### Potential Ingredients for Options

Consider including or excluding:

- Who has access to you
- How people contact you (i.e. Slack, email, telephone, Zoom)
- Access to vetted network (i.e. freelancers, partners, investors)
- Access to additional resources (templates, training, methodology)
- Areas you'll advise on or not (i.e. Sales, Marketing)
- Number of calls per month
- Unlimited access to you or not – and for whom
- Copy me on emails/join supplier
- Private or group training
- Deliverables or not
- Proactive vs. reactive advice
- Oversight or not
- Manage projects or not
- In-person or online
- Initial commitment period
- Payment terms
- Response times

### Common Structures [01:04:44]

- **Interim/Fractional CMO**
- **Advisory**
- **Coaching/Mentoring**

---

## Presenting Your Proposal [01:07:46]

**Critical rule:** Share your proposal live on your Zoom during a call – never send it in advance.

**Process:**

1. State your options + fees for each option and then don't say anything
2. Gauge your client's reaction
3. Ask them if they have a preference
4. Make a recommendation
5. If you get pushback on price or scope, ask them what they were hoping to see instead

### Overcoming Price Objections [01:10:52]

**If price seems to be the main factor, you have a few ways to respond:**

- "In order to do this right …."
- "If all we did was improve your business objective by x% it would mean covering my costs – not to mention long-term benefit"
- "What would you like me to remove in order to accommodate your budget?"
- "I believe this low-price option is your best bet based on everything you've told me about your situation …."
- **If price is their only factor, it might be best to walk away.** The most price-sensitive tend to be the least-ideal clients to work with

---

## Pricing [01:14:10]

### Core Pricing Principles

- **Think (and speak) in terms of value** - Not hours, not deliverables, but outcomes
- **Work backward from budget** and factor in their implementation costs in addition to yours
- **Your fees are an investment – not a fixed overhead** - Your fees aren't forever
- **Price anchor against their other expenses** - Put your fees in context
- **Price anchor against the cost of an employee** - Fractional/consultant comparison
- **Aim for 10x returns** over a reasonable period (i.e. 1-3 years)
- You won't always achieve a measurable positive ROI with every client. That's okay
- **Make a conservative financial business case** for your fees

### Examples of a Business Case [01:18:02]

Frame your value in concrete financial terms:

- If all we did was sell one new account that would otherwise go unsold
- You're going to deploy $300k on marketing this year – what's the cost of wasting it or not measuring properly?
- If we improved your website's conversion by X it would mean …
- If we helped increase your leads by even 10% it would mean …
- If you increased your close rate by X% it would result in …
- You're spending $500k+ to open this business - my fees are negligible in comparison and de-risk that investment

---

## Guarantees [01:19:10]

**Offer a guarantee if you can:**

- Limit it to a trial period to make it less risky to try working with you
- **100% Money-Back Guarantee** – "If we're not a good fit, I don't want your money. If you're unsatisfied for any reason after the first 30 days, I'll refund my entire fee in full."

---

## A Note on Your Website [01:21:51]

**In the beginning:**

- Keep your services copy light
- Focus on typical outcomes and benefits you create
- Avoid over-detailing before you have proven results

---

## Additional Q&A

### Question: "What's a formula you use to establish what's fair to price based on value?" [01:26:21]

### Question: "Besides getting inbound flow from creating a personal brand, what other strategies have worked for you to get great gigs? Have you tried cold DMs? Interested in how you've done it." [01:28:06]

### Question: "The cost and 'deliverables' tend to be an issue. I tend to get pushback on the cost and they don't only want advice and guidance, they tend to want more tangible outputs. I always want to make sure I over-deliver, so feel the need to implement or do something extra to wow them." [01:31:29]

### Question: "What are the top 5 mistakes you see advisory make and what would you do differently?" [01:33:14]

### Question: "How do you recommend others go about niching down? I know that's the ultimate ideal, become a big fish in a small pond, BUT I get inbound from different industries and don't want to close that door. So curious about your thoughts on how to go about it and when to do it." [01:35:02]

**Response:** [01:35:05]

## Key Quotes

### Max Bill, Form, Function, Beauty = Gestalt [01:37:05]

> "... it is not our job … to make standard everyday objects easier to sell by adding superfluous kitsch; rather it is our common task to make these objects in such a way that they serve people in the best, most lasting and beautiful manner possible. And it's precisely this so-called 'value-creating ornament' that diverts us from this fine task."

### Jason Fried, 37signals (2003) [01:37:49]

> "We're not designers, or programmers, or information architects, or copywriters, or customer experience consultants, or whatever else people want to call themselves these days… Bottom line: We're risk managers. Designers who sell "design," programmers who sell "code," information architects who sell "diagrams" are selling the wrong thing. The thing to sell is reduced risk for the client. That's what people want."
