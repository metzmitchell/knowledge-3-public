## Core Mindsets

### Understanding Your Client's Perspective

- **Modern marketing is overwhelming to a typical entrepreneur** - They're looking at you as their guide to navigate a complex, nuanced, uncertain world
- **It's easy to assume expertise isn't valuable** - Just because you have expertise doesn't mean your clients do
- **It's daunting when you aren't tech-savvy or a marketing expert** - Clients struggle to know what to do and how to spend money
- **Clients are spending significant money** - People spend $5k, $10k, multiple tens of thousands, sometimes significantly more on marketing monthly
- **They need someone on their side** - "I'm going to be on your side of the table and guide you through this process"

### Your Role as Fractional CMO

- **Aim to own the whole marketing problem** - If there's something to do with marketing, face it together
- **You've solved enough of these** - You know how to navigate decisions, measure results, and who to hire
- **You own that job for them** - Don't say "I'm going to only do this part and leave the rest to you"
- **You're very close to the CEO** - You're the thing that separates the CEO and the rest of their marketing
- **That's everything to do with marketing and growth** - Full ownership of the marketing function

### Strategic Perspective on Fractional CMO

- **Fractional CMO is part of the journey, not the final destination** - Generally speaking, it's not very high leverage
- **It can end up feeling like you own a job** - That comes with risks
- **Use it to harden your theories** - Battle test your ideas and get your hands back on the steering wheel
- **Make your consulting work more effective** - Ensures your theories match up to the real world
- **The real world is always changing** - Fractional work keeps you current

## Market Context & Trends

### Industry Growth

- **Increasing trend in fractional leadership** - Fractional CMOs in particular
- **Since 2019, just before the pandemic** - Significant growth in the industry
- **2016-2017** - Still a quiet industry when Kevin got into it
- **Google Trends shows increasing interest** - Official recognition of the trend

### Ideal Client Profile

**Fractional CMO is ideal for clients who:**

- Are **too small to hire a full-time role** but have expanding marketing needs
- **Typical agencies don't fit into** their needs
- Are looking for **greater flexibility**
- **Don't have a huge budget** and need to make every dollar spread as far as possible
- Have a **small marketing team of junior to intermediate marketers** who need a more senior role
- Need someone on an **interim basis as a stop gap**

**Company size sweet spot:**

- Usually **$1 million to $10 million range**
- **$3-5 million is kind of a sweet spot**

**Example use case:**

- Client no longer has a marketing manager
- Had two employees, now have zero
- Currently managing their stuff (babysitting it)
- **Always contain it to a maximum of three months** - That's the way the business model works
- Don't want it to derail everything you do

## Defining Your Fractional CMO Service

### The Beauty of a New Industry

- **You get to define what it means for you** - "I'm a fractional CMO" can mean different things
- **Compare fractional CMO websites** - They're all going to be a little bit different, and that's okay
- **You get to say "Here's what I'm going to do"** - The CMO at a $5 million company and the CMO at Apple do vastly different things

### Setting Boundaries

**Key questions to answer:**

- **Here's what I will do**
- **Here's how deep in the weeds I'll get**
- **Here's what I won't do**

**Example:** The CMO of Apple is not spell checking a social media post, nor do they see every ad created that goes out.

**Where is that middle ground?**

- Depends on the **size of the business**
- Depends on **how much they're paying you**
- Depends on **what you decide** is going to be the way you do your CMO services

**Critical principle:** Anything you don't do, you have to compensate for either by:
- Hiring someone else to do it
- Teaching the client to do it
- Saying it's not important

## Service Positioning & Boundaries

### What Fractional CMO Includes

**Core responsibilities:**

- Own the whole marketing program
- Strategic planning and direction
- Team management (if they have a team)
- Budget management
- Vendor/agency management
- Performance measurement and reporting
- Decision-making on marketing investments

### What It Doesn't Include

**Things to explicitly exclude or delegate:**

- Day-to-day execution (unless specifically included)
- Content creation (unless part of your package)
- Social media posting (unless part of your package)
- Email marketing execution (unless part of your package)
- Graphic design work
- Website development
- Other specialized execution tasks

**Key principle:** Be clear about what you do and don't do upfront to avoid scope creep.

---

## Pricing & Packaging

### Pricing Considerations

- **Work backward from budget** - Factor in their implementation costs in addition to yours
- **Price anchor against their other expenses** - Put your fees in context
- **Price anchor against the cost of an employee** - Fractional/consultant comparison
- **Aim for 10x returns** over a reasonable period (1-3 years)
- **Make a conservative financial business case** for your fees

### Package Structure

**Consider offering tiers:**

1. **Lightweight option** - Gets the job done but may require more time/work on their behalf
2. **Standard option** - What they asked for in terms of budget, aligns with your sweet spot
3. **Premium option** - Most robust methods and highest level of access

**Package ingredients to consider:**

- Who has access to you
- How people contact you (Slack, email, telephone, Zoom)
- Number of calls per month
- Unlimited access to you or not – and for whom
- Access to vetted network (freelancers, partners, investors)
- Access to additional resources (templates, training, methodology)
- Areas you'll advise on or not (Sales, Marketing)
- Copy me on emails/join supplier
- Private or group training
- Deliverables or not
- Proactive vs. reactive advice
- Oversight or not
- Manage projects or not
- In-person or online
- Initial commitment period
- Payment terms
- Response times

## Sales Process

### Initial Qualification

**When a client reaches out:**

- Do a quick pre-qualification
- Invite them to chat about their business on Zoom/phone call
- **Ensure the financial buyer is on the call** - Critical for moving forward
- Record the call to reference later (with their permission)

### Discovery Questions

**Understanding their business:**

- "Tell me a little about your business…"
- Understand how they make money (unless they're in your niche)
- What makes them unique or better than the competition?
- What category(ies) of products/services do they sell?
- Where do they make their money?

**Understanding their goals:**

- "What does a home run look like?"
- What are your goals?
- How will you measure progress towards these goals?
- Where are you today in relation to these goals?

**Understanding their situation:**

- What's working and not working?
- Where are their bottlenecks?
- How bad is the problem?
- What have you tried already?
- Why not do this in-house/DIY?
- Who/what other options are you considering?
- Why me? I'm not the cheapest …
- Why now? Couldn't you do this slowly or later?

**Budget discussion:**

- Do you have a budget in mind for this?
- Is it $10K, $100K, $1 million?
- Do some napkin math about total budget if needed

### Presenting Your Proposal

**Critical rule:** Share your proposal live on your Zoom during a call – never send it in advance.

**Process:**

1. State your options + fees for each option and then don't say anything
2. Gauge your client's reaction
3. Ask them if they have a preference
4. Make a recommendation
5. If you get pushback on price or scope, ask them what they were hoping to see instead

## Client Acquisition Strategies

### Best Sources of Clients

1. **Personal brand/inbound flow** - Creating content and building your reputation
2. **Referrals from existing clients** - "Who else should I talk to?" or "Can you introduce me to…"
3. **Referrals from partners** - Other consultants, agencies, service providers
4. **Speaking/teaching** - Workshops, webinars, conferences
5. **Content marketing** - Blog posts, case studies, thought leadership
6. **Networking** - Industry events, communities, mastermind groups

### Platforms to Consider (With Caution)

**Hiring platforms:**

- MarketerHire
- Mylance
- Passionfruit
- TopTal
- GrowthCollective

**Important notes:**

- **Leads have always been not great** - Even when successful, clients come in colder
- **Less trusting** - More skepticism than other sources
- **More like "I want to talk to your references"** - Higher friction
- **Not great for building trust** - You want to have trust before you even consider working together
- **Wouldn't depend on these platforms** - Try to find your own clients
- **Doesn't hurt to have your line in the water** - But expect lower quality

---

## Service Delivery Best Practices

### Maintaining Professional Boundaries

**If you look and act like an employee, you'll be treated like one:**

- **Don't go to client employee events** - Even when working with clients locally
- **Maybe the odd grand opening** - But be selective
- **Won't go to employee sessions** - Team building, morale improvement, etc.
- **Don't take a company email address** - Take a marketing email and help manage that, but don't accept kevin@thecompanyname.com
- **If you are employee shaped, you're going to be treated like an employee** - That erodes the value in their eyes, view as an expert

### LinkedIn Considerations

**LinkedIn experience is a double-edged sword:**

- **Some people put it** - But it can look weird to have a hundred different past CMO clients
- **It's a way for people to potentially poach your clients** - Risk of client poaching
- **They get notified when you do that as a job** - "Someone tagged themselves as working at your place"
- **It can be misleading** - You didn't "work" there in the traditional sense
- **It positions you as an employee-shaped figure** - Which you don't want to be

**Better alternatives:**

- **List them in your bio** - "I helped companies like…"
- **If they're big names, put them in there** - But not as job experience
- **Get testimonials instead** - Better way to show credibility
- **Get references** - More appropriate for consulting work

### Working with Clients

**Be okay with pushing back on your clients' ideas:**

- Remember, **you're a consultant, not an employee**
- Just because your clients have a lot of great ideas, **many of them aren't great**
- Many of them are great, but **your job is to assess based on their goals**

**Find great implementation partners and take good care of them:**

- When you find someone who's really good at their thing, **really, really, really take good care of them**
- **Make sure they're treated well** - By you and by the client
- **Make sure they get what they need** - Brief them effectively so they're not floundering
- **Maintain good relationships** - They'll learn your style and make every project easier
- **Take good care of them** - So you're not having to constantly find new people
- **Make sure they're paid on time** - Critical for maintaining relationships

**Stay close to the money:**

- **People are hiring you as a path to earning and saving money**
- **The more you can prove your value in terms of ROI** - Keep a reasonable timeline
- **Six months to a year is the minimum** - Clients will start to see a return on investment definitely within a year
- **Pay attention to the financials** - How much are they spending? What performance and results are they getting?
- **Show your value** - Show progress on the key metrics that matter

## Positioning & Terminology

### Titles You Can Use

**Preferred titles:**

- **Fractional CMO** - Most common and recognized
- **Producer** - One that Kevin coined
- **Interim CMO** - Part-time, short-term positioning
- **Freelance CMO** - If your clients are smaller businesses, can feel less intimidating
- **Fractional Marketing Director** - Good alternative
- **Fractional Head of Growth** - Growth marketing positioning
- **Head of Growth** - Being used more and more

**Titles to avoid or use carefully:**

- **Part-time CMO** - Feels less professional
- **Part-time Marketing Manager** - Too execution-focused, positions you in an execution role
- **Freelance Marketing Manager** - If you really want to go small biz, but be careful
- **Fractional Head of [Small Function]** - Like "fractional head of onboarding" - Sets you as a set of hands
- **Fractional Social Media Manager** - Too narrow, don't get too fancy with it

### Key Principles for Title Selection

- **Avoid terms that position you in an execution role** - Like part-time marketing manager
- **Keep your title close to CEO level** - CMO, director level stuff is probably the best
- **Either you own the whole marketing program or you don't** - Don't position yourself as head of something too small
- **Focus on them and what their perception would be** - You're a marketing consultant and the service you offer is a producer role based on the target market

### Important Notes on Credentials

**It's okay to call yourself a fractional CMO even if you've never been a CMO:**

- **People weren't born CMOs** - Everyone starts somewhere
- **A lot of people work in corporate jobs** - Two or three corporate jobs, then become a CMO
- **You don't need to have been a CMO to have all the skills** - The question is, can you get a result and can you lead marketing?
- **That's all that really matters** - Results and leadership ability

---

## Long-Term Strategy

### Transitioning Clients

**Your whole goal is to transition clients, if you can, into an advisory role:**

- **So that you're not a long-term manager** - You're an advisor
- **Tell clients upfront that that's your intention** - Set expectations
- **Ideally, at some point they hire someone in-house** - And you move to advisory
- **Or they run with it themselves** - You've set them up for success
- **Ideally you don't want to live on this train forever** - It is less leveraged than other models

### Why Transition?

- **It's less leveraged** - Than running an agency or other models
- **It's more stressful** - Managing day-to-day operations long-term
- **Advisory is higher leverage** - More strategic, less operational
- **Better for your business model** - Allows you to work with more clients

---

## Miscellaneous Best Practices

### Client Management

- **Set clear boundaries** - What you will and won't do
- **Be transparent about your process** - How you work, what to expect
- **Communicate regularly** - But not like an employee checking in
- **Focus on outcomes** - Not just activities
- **Document everything** - Processes, decisions, results

### Professional Development

- **Use fractional CMO work to harden your theories** - Battle test your ideas
- **Get your hands back on the steering wheel** - Stay current with real-world application
- **Make your consulting work more effective** - Ensures theories match reality
- **The real world is always changing** - Fractional work keeps you current

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Clients who want you to act like an employee** - Too many meetings, too much oversight
- **Scope creep** - Asking for things outside your defined role
- **Unrealistic expectations** - Wanting results too quickly
- **Budget constraints** - Not enough budget to do the work properly
- **Lack of decision-making authority** - Can't make decisions without multiple approvals
