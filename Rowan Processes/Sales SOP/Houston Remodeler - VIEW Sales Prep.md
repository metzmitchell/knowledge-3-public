## Pre-Conversation VIEW State Check

Before the call, check in with yourself:

- **Vulnerability**: Am I acknowledging what I don't know about their specific situation? Am I ready to be honest if we're not a fit?
- **Impartiality**: Am I attached to closing this deal, or genuinely open to what's best for them?
- **Empathy**: Can I understand their expansion challenges, marketing constraints, and owner's perspective?
- **Wonder**: Am I genuinely curious about their business, or am I leading them toward my solutions?

**Remember**: You're there to understand, not to sell. If this is a good fit, you'll both know it. If it's not, that's valuable information too.

## VIEW Framework Conversation Guide

### Opening with Vulnerability & Wonder

**Approach:**
- Start with genuine curiosity, not a pitch
- Acknowledge you don't know their specific situation yet
- Be honest about what you need to understand

**Example Opening:**
> "I'm excited to learn about your business. Before I tell you about what I do, I want to be honest: I'm not sure if we're a fit yet. I need to understand your situation better. Can you help me understand what's really driving your interest in exploring marketing help right now?"

### Key VIEW-Based Questions

#### Understanding Their Business (Wonder)

**Focus on "how" and "what" questions:**

- "How does your business work day-to-day?"
- "What does a typical project look like from inquiry to completion?"
- "What types of projects are most profitable for you?"
- "How do clients typically find you today?"
- "What makes you different from other high-end remodelers in Houston?"

**Avoid:**
- Leading questions ("Don't you think you need better marketing?")
- Yes/no questions ("Is marketing a problem for you?")
- Why questions (they carry judgment)

#### Current State & Challenges (Empathy)

**Understand their perspective, constraints, and experience:**

- "What's working well in your marketing right now?"
- "What hasn't worked as well as you hoped?"
- "What constraints are you working within that I might not be aware of?"
- "Help me understand what the marketing situation feels like from your position."

**Listen for:**
- Pain points in their own words
- Quantifiable problems
- Emotional concerns (trust, risk, reputation)
- Resource constraints (time, budget, team capacity)

#### Expansion Plans (Impartiality)

**Explore without attachment to your solutions:**

- "Tell me about your plans for expansion over the next three years."
- "What markets are you considering?"
- "What would need to be true for expansion to work well?"
- "What concerns do you have about expanding?"

**Notice:**
- Are they following clients or chasing demographics?
- Do they have infrastructure to support expansion?
- What's driving the expansion timeline?

#### Marketing Team Structure (Empathy)

**Understand their current setup:**

- "How does your marketing team work together?"
- "What's the marketing manager focused on day-to-day?"
- "What marketing tasks is the admin person handling?"
- "Where do you feel the gaps are?"

#### Goals & Outcomes (Wonder)

**Let them define success:**

- "What does a home run look like for your marketing?"
- "What would need to happen for you to feel like marketing is working really well?"
- "How would you measure progress toward that?"
- "What's driving your interest in exploring this now?"

**Avoid:**
- Suggesting what success should look like
- Leading them toward your definition of success

#### Budget & Investment (Vulnerability & Impartiality)

**Be honest about what's needed:**

- "What's your current marketing budget?"
- "Have you thought about what you'd be comfortable investing?"
- "For a $15M business, industry benchmarks suggest 3-5% on marketing—that's typically $37K-$62K/month total. How does that compare to what you're thinking?"

**Be ready to say:**
- "If that budget range doesn't work, I can tell you what might be possible within your constraints, or I can be honest if I don't think we can achieve meaningful results at that level."

#### Why Now? (Wonder)

- "What's different now that makes this a priority?"
- "What have you tried in the past?"
- "What's the cost of not doing this?"

## Key Reminders

### VIEW State Reminders

1. **You're not there to sell** - You're there to understand if there's mutual fit
2. **Release attachment to the outcome** - If this isn't right, that's valuable information
3. **Be genuinely curious** - Ask "how" and "what" questions, not leading questions
4. **Acknowledge what you don't know** - It builds trust more than false confidence

### Industry-Specific Reminders

**For $15M remodeler:**

- Trust and fit matter more than price

**For expansion planning:**
- Multi-location marketing requires different thinking

- **Can't articulate clear goals** - Might not be ready
- **Unrealistic budget expectations** - May need education or different fit
- **Not willing to be transparent** - Hard to help if they hide problems

**How to handle red flags (from VIEW state):**

- Acknowledge what you're noticing with curiosity
- Be honest about concerns

### Green Flags to Notice

- **Clear goals and vision** - Know what they want
- **Realistic budget** - Understand investment required
- **Willing to be transparent** - Trust-building possible
- **Long-term thinking** - Understand marketing takes time
- **See you as peer/partner** - Relationship-focused, not transactional

After the call, check in with yourself:

1. **Vulnerability**: What did I learn that I didn't know before? What am I still uncertain about?

3. **Empathy**: Did I truly understand their perspective, constraints, and situation?

**If moving forward:**

## Financial Considerations

### Budget Context

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- $15M business: 3-5% on marketing = $37,500-$62,500/month
- Total marketing investment = Your fees + Their marketing spend

**Your Fees Context:**
- Your fees are an investment in ensuring their marketing spend is effective
- If they're spending $40K/month on marketing, your $5K/month fee is 12.5% "insurance premium"
- Frame as: "What's the cost of wasting your marketing spend or not measuring properly?"

### ROI Calculations to Explore

**Understand their math:**
- Average project value?
- Project margins? (Typically 12-20% for builders/remodelers)
- How many projects do they need to close to justify investment?
- Current lead metrics?

**Frame the value:**
- "If all we did was help you close one additional project per year, what would that be worth?"
- "If we improved your close rate by X%, what would that mean?"
- "What's the cost of not doing this?"

**From Kevin's Sales Thinking:**
> "You're there to help, not to sell. Think like a co-buyer. Be curious longer."
