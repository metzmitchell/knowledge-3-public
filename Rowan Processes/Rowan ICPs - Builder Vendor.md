# Rowan ICPs - Builder Vendor
**Ideal Customer Profile – Builder Vendors**

---

### **1. Company Snapshot**

- **What they sell:** A product or service used in the construction process (materials, tech, trade services, consulting).
- **Target market:** Small-to-midsize builders—about 5-50 employees— residential & commercial
- **Team size:** 2-30 people, usually founder-led; no dedicated marketing department.
- **Sales model:** Relationship-driven, deal values ≥ $5 k, repeat or long-term potential.

### **2. Decision Maker**

- Owner, president, or a “wears-many-hats” BD/ops lead who also handles marketing.
- Comfortable spending $3 k–$7 k per month for 6+ months if the path to booked meetings is clear.

### **3. Pain Triggers**

- Great offering but struggling to start conversations with the right builders.
- Website and content feel generic; leads are inconsistent or low quality.
- Previous agency or ad spend produced vanity metrics, not sales activity.
- No internal bandwidth to run targeted outbound or nurture sequences.

### **4. Success Markers**

- 5–20 warm builder meetings booked within the first 90 days.
- Clear message that resonates with owner-level builders.
- A repeatable outreach and follow-up system living in their CRM.
- Measurable ROI tied to pipeline value, not clicks or impressions.

### **5. Fit Checklist**

- ✔ Sells directly to small/mid builders as a core revenue stream.
- ✔ Values leads, not just “more marketing.”
- ✔ Willing to invest time and budget to build a sustainable pipeline.

- **Services:** New builds, remodels, additions, or niche commercial (e.g., hospitality, small multifamily)

### **2. Decision Maker**

- Owner, partner, or ops or sales manager who’s also responsible for growth and lead flow

- Marketing is inconsistent, underfunded, or scattered across tools and people

- They're frustrated with generic agency offers or DIY marketing tools

### **4. Success Markers**

- More consistent pipeline of qualified projects
- Better brand alignment: trust before the first call
- Marketing system that works without daily oversight
- Clear insight into what’s working and what’s not (CRM, analytics, etc.)

### **5. Fit Checklist**

- ✔ Willing to collaborate and invest in internal marketing system, not just delegate
- ✔ Has the budget to invest in strategy + execution ($4k–$10k/mo range for full marketing budget)
- ✔ Believes in quality work and reputation — not just volume
