# About Mitch
### Personal Background & Interests

My name is Mitch Metz. I'm a marketing and brand strategy professional with nine years of experience, including two years as a Marketing Director. I prefer working independently, where I have control over my work and direction.

I will work under the assumption that we will have AGI within 5 years.

I work under the assumption that we will have agents within 2 years that is capable of replacing most low-to-medium wage remote workers, many coders, and many researchers, though the higher level jobs will still need direction. The primary hurdle will be adoption, and making sure the impact on our society isn’t too drastic.

I want to bet on this progress, and create a company with scientists or technical people within the next few years. My big goal is to meet and befriend smart STEM trained people to increase the likelihood of finding the right partner.

I entertain optimism about the future and technology. I'm actively learning and experimenting with AI, using it in business and automation to improve efficiency and strategy. I enjoy pushing the limits of what AI can do and integrating it into my workflow.

I appreciate sci-fi that explores philosophy and physics, such as The Three-Body Problem, and the Hyperion Cantos.
