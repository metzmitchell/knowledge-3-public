# Marketing Philosophy

## Core Beliefs for Builder and Remodeler Marketing

### Unique Positioning Philosophy
- **"I help builders and remodelers get projects more consistently than referrals and with more transparency than an agency"**
- **Graduate from referrals to in-house marketing** without full agency dependence
- **Medium price, high quality, low convenience, custom individualized service**
- **Build marketing foundation within your company** rather than outsourcing everything

### Revolutionary Beliefs
- **Education is a commodity** - focus on advanced insights with unique angles
- **Ignore flashy scalable strategies, focus on relationships, 1-to-few**
- **1-to-1 and in-person interactions** over mass marketing
- **Human connection in digital age** - Technology should enhance, not replace relationships
- **Trust through transparency** - Direct approach without markup games or hidden agendas

### Trust-Critical Environment
- **One wrong move hurts the brand** in high-stakes industry
